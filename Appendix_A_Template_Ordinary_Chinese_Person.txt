Object Type: Ordinary individual in a structured society  
Evaluation Dimensions: FFI, CSI, CHS, EOI, RUI, HCCI  

---

## 1. Basic Scores  

FFI (Functional Fabric Index): 3.8 / 10  
Moderate ability for social adaptation and cooperation, but weak innovation and critical thinking. Obedience is prioritized over creativity. Information absorption is primarily exam-oriented.  

CSI (Cancerous Structure Index): 5.5 / 10  
Language, emotions, and power structures are deeply internalized. Examples include: filial piety as absolute, submission to authority, shame-based education, and pervasive nationalism.  

CHS (Civilization Health Score): –1.7  
Predominantly negative structure. Characterized by docility combined with deep indoctrination, making individuals easily manipulated by hierarchical structures and carriers of transmissible authoritarian memes.

## 4. EOI (Effectiveness of Influence)  

Formula:  
EOI = (R × C × S × F × I × L)^T  

Parameters:  
- R (Reach): 100 — Daily social circle (friends, colleagues)  
- C (Cognitive Penetration): 0.3 — Weak, repeats others’ views  
- S (Structural Penetration): 0.1 — No impact on institutions  
- F (Frequency × Duration): 2.0 — Frequent, shallow interactions  
- I (Amplification): 0.1 — No organizational platform  
- L (Leverage): 1.0 — Lowest social tier, no leverage  
- T (Network Amplification): 1.1 — Minor effect from online echo  

Result:  
EOI ≈ (100 × 0.3 × 0.1 × 2 × 0.1 × 1)^{1.1} ≈ (0.6)^{1.1} ≈ 0.53  

📌 EOI = 0.5 (Very Low)  

---

## 5. RUI (Reverse Unification Index)  

Formula:  
RUI = CSI × EOI × (1 + (|CSI| × EOI^{0.1}) / 10)  

Substitution:  
= 5.5 × 0.5 × (1 + (5.5 × 0.93) / 10) ≈ 4.2  

📌 RUI ≈ 4.2 (Moderate Diffusion Power)  

Explanation: Even with low individual influence, large population size and meme consistency may form a strong collective assimilation force.  

---

## 6. HCCI (Human Civilization Contribution Index)  

Formula:  
HCCI = CHS × RUI  

Substitution:  
= –1.7 × 4.2 ≈ –7.1  

📌 HCCI ≈ –7.1 (Structural Negative Contribution)  

Explanation:  
This group, due to deep indoctrination and tendency to spread authoritarian memes, functions as a structural infection host. While often well-meaning, its overall contribution is negative from the perspective of global free civilization.

## 7. Structural Classification  

| Category           | Status           | Explanation |
|--------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Functional Cell    | ✘ Not Present   | FFI too low, lacks independent thought |
| Silent Cell        | ✔ Present       | Adapts well socially, but not resistant or creative |
| Cancer Cell (Ind.) | ⚠ Partially Hit | High CSI × Low EOI → low-diffusion structural cancer host |
| Civilization Pathogen | ⚠ Group Hit  | Weak individuals, but strong group conformity, amplifies harmful collective behavior |
