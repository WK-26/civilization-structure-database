<p>V. Structural Writing System: The Deep Mechanism of Civilizational Domestication</p>
<p>Appendix E | Structural Language Lexicon and Cancerous Meme Index</p>
<p>Introduction: Language as the Invisible Weapon of Structure</p>
<p>The civilizational structure of human society is not built only by laws and institutions; a deeper layer of control hides within language. Language is not merely a vehicle of information; it is the deep carrier of ideology, power structures, emotional control, and value systems. It shapes not only what people say, but how they think—and even whether they can think.</p>
<p>In structural civilizations, language becomes an invisible tool of domestication: it helps power maintain rule, helps families exert control, and helps collectives assimilate the individual. In these systems, the essence of language shifts from communication toward formatting, command, and legitimation. This is structural language—it does not serve understanding; it serves order and hierarchy.</p>
<p>Memes—informational particles within civilization—once combined with the control mechanisms of structural language, transform into cancerous memes. These look ordinary yet continuously spread emotions such as repression, submission, collectivism, and fear among individuals—quietly shaping personality groups that are highly uniform yet lack self-awareness, thereby constructing a “compliant populace” and a “domesticated civilization.”</p>
<p>The real danger of language and memes lies in their everydayness—they often appear as parental care, teachers’ admonitions, patriotic passion, or moral high ground. Highly deceptive, they corrode the civilizational immune system over time, weakening individual judgment, autonomy, and human dignity.</p>
<p>Therefore, the first step to building a civilizational immune system is to identify these structural languages and cancerous memes. In this appendix we systematically sort two categories:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Structural Language Lexicon: entries repeatedly seen in family, school, institutions, collectives, nationalism, and moral discourse—analyzing their control mechanisms and civilizational harms;</p></li>
<li><p>Cancerous Meme Index: slogans, cultural symbols, and propagating units with structural destructive power—analyzing their meme structure, psychological bait, and diffusion mechanisms.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Only by keeping critical awareness toward language can we truly build civilizational immunity. The question we must ask is no longer “Is this statement correct?” but “What structural intention lies behind this statement?” — This marks the awakening of structural civilizational consciousness.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>Structural Language Lexicon (Detailed Entries)</li>
</ol>
<p>This section lists common “structural language” samples in structural civilizations. These utterances seem everyday, gentle, even caring, yet their deep logic embeds control mechanisms of suppression, obedience, shaming, and stratification.</p>
<p>Each sample includes four elements:</p>
<p>• Original expression (typical wording)</p>
<p>• Functional explanation (its control function in social structure)</p>
<p>• Harm analysis (specific damage to individual/relationships/civilization)</p>
<p>• Civilizational-immunity suggestion (recommended alternative or structural response)</p>
<p>Family and Kinship Structural Language</p>
<p>• [Original] “I’m doing this for your own good.”</p>
<p>Function: Parents repackage their will as absolute legitimacy in the name of “love.”</p>
<p>Harm: Denies individual judgment, blocks children’s willingness to express, creates emotional debt and self-doubt.</p>
<p>Immunity Suggestion: “I have my viewpoint, but I’m willing to hear yours.”</p>
<p>• [Original] “You’re making me lose face.”</p>
<p>Function: Binds the other’s behavior to one’s own “face.”</p>
<p>Harm: Uses shame to drive obedience, building a relationship mechanism where “face” is a control lever.</p>
<p>Immunity Suggestion: “I may feel worried about your decision, but I respect you.”</p>
<p>• [Original] “After raising you all these years, is this your attitude?”</p>
<p>Function: Establishes a transactional frame: bloodline upbringing ↔︎ emotional obedience.</p>
<p>Harm: Turns love into debt; past contributions are used to seal off expression and block equal parent-child dialogue.</p>
<p>Immunity Suggestion: “I gave because I love you, but you still have freedom of choice.”</p>
<p>Authority and Institutional Discourse</p>
<p>• [Original] “The organization has already decided.”</p>
<p>Function: Uses a vague collective to suppress individual judgment.</p>
<p>Harm: Denies decision rights, blurs responsibility, and creates the illusion of inescapable fate.</p>
<p>Immunity Suggestion: “Let’s discuss the reasons behind this decision.”</p>
<p>• [Original] “If you don’t understand, don’t speak carelessly.”</p>
<p>Function: Establishes a speech-rights threshold.</p>
<p>Harm: Blocks public discussion, belittles dissent, manufactures “expert worship” and fear of expression.</p>
<p>Immunity Suggestion: “Your view may be incomplete, but you’re welcome to explore together.”</p>
<p>• [Original] “Are you opposing the state?”</p>
<p>Function: Equates dissent with betrayal.</p>
<p>Harm: Labels criticism as hostility, creates collective coercion, blocks rational critique.</p>
<p>Immunity Suggestion: “Loving a country doesn’t mean it cannot be criticized.”</p>
<p>Nationalist Structural Discourse</p>
<p>• [Original] “As a Chinese person, you must …”</p>
<p>Function: Forces identity to bind behavior.</p>
<p>Harm: Erases individual diversity, manufactures a single national-identity logic, locks people into “role-obedience.”</p>
<p>Immunity Suggestion: “Everyone can freely interpret their own identity.”</p>
<p>• [Original] “Insulting China.”</p>
<p>Function: Elevates criticism into racial offense.</p>
<p>Harm: Abolishes space for rational critique, manufactures moral intimidation and social mobbing.</p>
<p>Immunity Suggestion: “Expressing dissent is participation, not insult.”</p>
<p>• [Original] “Slandering the motherland.”</p>
<p>Function: Attributes hostile motive to criticism.</p>
<p>Harm: Twists others’ motives, triggers collective attacks, suppresses public expression.</p>
<p>Immunity Suggestion: “Raising problems is aimed at improvement.”</p>
<p>Moral-Blackmail Language</p>
<p>• [Original] “Doesn’t your conscience hurt?”</p>
<p>Function: Induces self-shame to force moral obedience.</p>
<p>Harm: Weakens boundaries, manufactures the self-eroding structure of “living for others.”</p>
<p>Immunity Suggestion: “Let’s discuss your decision rationally.”</p>
<p>• [Original] “Don’t be selfish—think of others.”</p>
<p>Function: Denies individual rights, exalts collective interests.</p>
<p>Harm: Glorifies sacrifice and denies the self, forming the structural domestication that “sacrifice = virtue.”</p>
<p>Immunity Suggestion: “Balancing self and others matters.”</p>
<p>• [Original] “Do you even deserve to be human?”</p>
<p>Function: Totally denies personal dignity and value.</p>
<p>Harm: Imposes humiliating verbal violence, inducing self-negation and social withdrawal.</p>
<p>Immunity Suggestion: “We’re discussing behavior, not your personhood.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Appendix E-3 | Cancerous Meme Index</p>
<p>In authoritarian civilizations or highly structured oppressive societies, memes are not merely cultural symbols but tools of structural control. Through emotional inducement and institutional cooperation, such language and cultural slogans achieve deep colonization of individual thinking and social behavior. Below are typical high-destructiveness “cancerous memes” and their mechanisms:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“Family and nation are one.”</li>
</ol>
<p>• Diffusion mechanism: Reinforced via education systems, TV dramas, and mainstream media; textbooks blur “family” and “nation,” indoctrinating loyalty.</p>
<p>• Emotional bait: Leverages family affection (e.g., “mother,” “motherland”) to create the link “betraying the nation = betraying parents.”</p>
<p>• How it suppresses free structures: Treats the state as an extension of the family’s emotional body, weakening civic rights consciousness and narrowing institutional debate space; strengthens unconditional obedience.</p>
<p>• Examples:</p>
<p>• College-entrance exam prompts guide students from “grand family-nation righteousness,” disciplining thought frames.</p>
<p>• Critics of policy on social media are labeled “ungrateful.”</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>“Unconditional obedience.”</li>
</ol>
<p>• Diffusion mechanism: Carried by military training, school slogans, and social hierarchy; “obey orders” is the cornerstone of collective order.</p>
<p>• Emotional bait: Packaged with positive terms such as “discipline,” “responsibility,” and “mission,” generating pride in self-repression.</p>
<p>• Suppression mode: Frames critical thinking as dangerous, uproots doubt and democratic discussion, forming an atmosphere of obedience to superiors.</p>
<p>• Examples:</p>
<p>• School management praises “obedience is a virtue,” suppressing questioning.</p>
<p>• Companies emphasize “obey leadership arrangements,” rejecting creativity and dissent.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>“Great, Glorious, Correct.”</li>
</ol>
<p>• Diffusion mechanism: Propaganda systems mythologize a party/leader as “always right” and “morally supreme.”</p>
<p>• Emotional bait: Fosters security and worship, making critique feel like a personal existential threat.</p>
<p>• Suppression mode: Creates “power that cannot be criticized,” eroding error-correction and genuine dialogue.</p>
<p>• Examples:</p>
<p>• State media lauds “great achievements” and “omnipotent leadership,” forbidding public discussion of failure or accountability.</p>
<p>• Social platforms delete content critical of the system and ban users.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>“Sacrifice the small self to accomplish the great self.”</li>
</ol>
<p>• Diffusion mechanism: From primary school to the military, instills “collective first,” framing personal sacrifice as noble.</p>
<p>• Emotional bait: Uses “martyr spirit” and “nameless heroes” to spur voluntary acceptance of repression and deprivation.</p>
<p>• Suppression mode: Prevents individuals from claiming rights, obstructs civic consciousness, preserves structural injustice.</p>
<p>• Examples:</p>
<p>• Medical workers during epidemics encouraged to “devote,” with basic rights/compensation ignored.</p>
<p>• Workers accept long overtime “for national development.”</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>“The people need ideological unity.”</li>
</ol>
<p>• Diffusion mechanism: Through opinion rectification, unified textbooks, and cyberspace governance to push “uniform thought.”</p>
<p>• Emotional bait: Creates a climate where “dissent = threat,” framing pluralism as “splitting the nation.”</p>
<p>• Suppression mode: Cuts off the path of intellectual diversity, destroys the basis for social deliberation, and reinforces a single ideology.</p>
<p>• Examples:</p>
<p>• Critical curriculums canceled; non-mainstream views labeled “wrong guidance.”</p>
<p>• Under “clean-up” campaigns, the space for expression keeps shrinking.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>“Collective interests above all.”</li>
</ol>
<p>• Diffusion mechanism: Institutional designs prioritize the vague notion of “collective interests,” sacrificing individual rights.</p>
<p>• Emotional bait: Praises “sacrifice is glorious,” stirring nationalism or group identity to suppress individual resistance.</p>
<p>• Suppression mode: Uses “collective morality” to domesticate individual will, granting legitimacy to power structures.</p>
<p>• Examples:</p>
<p>• In urban-village demolitions, individual protesters labeled “obstacles to development.”</p>
<p>• During public-health campaigns, personal freedom and health choices are forced to yield to “collective goals.”</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>“Controlling public opinion is necessary for national security.”</li>
</ol>
<p>• Diffusion mechanism: Uses “national security” as pretext to legitimate expanded online monitoring and opinion guidance.</p>
<p>• Emotional bait: Brands “free expression” as “incitement” or “foreign forces,” crafting a consensus that “expression = danger.”</p>
<p>• Suppression mode: Strips freedom of speech/press and public rights to criticize, forming an information black box.</p>
<p>• Examples:</p>
<p>• “Cybersecurity” provisions used to target whistle-blowers and rights defenders.</p>
<p>• Uniform media narratives; near-zero media independence.</p>

<li>Summary: How to Build Meme Immunity?</li>
</ol>
<p>In societies domesticated by language and oppressed by structure, thought, expression, and behavior are easily manipulated by memes. Building a meme-immunity system is a key step in civilizational self-rescue. Three core strategies:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Language training and critical recognition</li>
</ol>
<p>• Goal: Help individuals realize “language is never neutral.” Every sentence can carry power structures, cultural pathogens, or psychological control.</p>
<p>• Methods:</p>
<p>• Learn to identify structural language and “emotional blackmail,” e.g., “I’m doing this for your good,” “Do you even deserve …”</p>
<p>• Train a “pause” mechanism: on hearing such phrases, don’t react—ask the intent and structure behind them.</p>
<p>• Promote a Structural Language Recognition Sheet as a social literacy tool.</p>
<p>• Practice: When you hear “You’re not fitting in,” ask—who defines “fitting in”? Whose power does this requirement serve?</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Create healthy memes and alternative expressions</li>
</ol>
<p>• Goal: Not only to critique old language, but to actively build new civilizational expressions and positive bonds.</p>
<p>• Methods:</p>
<p>• Replace oppressive language with open, respectful, equal expressions:</p>
<p>• Replace “Be obedient” with “Let’s negotiate.”</p>
<p>• Replace “For your own good” with “I have a suggestion, but you decide.”</p>
<p>• Replace “Sacrifice the self” with “Voluntary choice and equal value.”</p>
<p>• Promote a Free Language Toolkit to help families, educators, and organizers shift linguistic styles.</p>
<p>• Note: Memes are re-makeable. We can craft new social consensuses like “ignite creativity,” “respect difference,” and “boundaries of love.”</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Beware the civilizational traps of language</li>
</ol>
<p>• Goal: Reveal that language is not just a tool of expression, but an invisible weapon of civilizational structure.</p>
<p>• Methods:</p>
<p>• Include language-structure analysis in education.</p>
<p>• Periodically “detox” political slogans, media headlines, and instructional language.</p>
<p>• Build a civilizational language map: trace historical evolution and social outcomes to understand latent risks.</p>
<p>• Reminder: The scariest trap of a civilization is not brute force but those words that sound gentle, reasonable, and uplifting—words that shape self-perception and define the boundaries of thought.</p>

<p>V. Structural Writing System: The Deep Mechanism of Domestication</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Structural Oppression of Chinese Characters</li>
</ol>
<p>Chinese characters are not merely a recording tool; they are a closed, non-phonemic, culturally self-reinforcing, highly domesticated writing system with the following structural features:</p>
<table style="width:97%;">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 30%" />

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Summary text:</p>
<p>We must face this: the coding of a civilization determines its fate. Just as programs shape behavioral systems, Chinese characters—this cultural code—are quietly constructing a mute society. To rebuild human civilization, we must rewrite the foundations of language.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>• 孝 (filial piety): “old” above “child” → root meaning: the child obeys the elder.</p>
<p>• 安 (peace): “roof” + “woman” → “a woman at home equals peace.”</p>
<p>This writing system engraves ethical structure into the script itself; from the moment literacy begins, domestication begins.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Language as Order: Structural Oppression Mechanisms in Chinese</li>
</ol>
<p>• Subject-erasing mechanism:</p>
<p>Chinese often uses passives and subject-less sentences, blurring responsibility.</p>
<p>• “Problems need to be solved.” → Whose problems? Who solves them?</p>
<p>• “It’s been decided from above.” → Who is “above”? Why authority?</p>
<p>Result: Creates the illusion that power is naturally given; individuals lose accountability and questioning consciousness.</p>
<p>• Imperative-first structure:</p>
<p>Chinese habitually starts with imperatives, e.g.:</p>
<p>• “You should …”</p>
<p>• “Hurry up …”</p>
<p>• “Do not …”</p>
<p>Result: Reinforces “obedience-first” thinking; advisory/negotiated language is scarce and weak.</p>

<li>Binding of Writing System and Ideology</li>
</ol>
<p>Chinese script has long been bound to political power:</p>
<p>• Han: Confucian script canonized as state orthodoxy.</p>
<p>• Qing: Tens of thousands punished for verses deemed to “ridicule emperors” (literary inquisitions).</p>
<p>• Maoist era: Character simplification as political re-engineering (e.g., 斗/批/改—struggle/criticize/reform).</p>
<p>• Contemporary: Sensitive-word systems extend into algorithms and platform governance—control embedded at the language input port.</p>
<p>🔒 The deepest civilizational infection is not what you say, but that you can only say it within these characters.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Language is civilization. Language is structure.</p>
<p>When we dismantle old language and rebuild new expressions, the true reconstruction of civilization begins.</p>
<p>From today, practice saying—</p>
<p>• “I respect you, but I do not accept your control.”</p>
<p>• “I feel your emotion, but I reserve my judgment.”</p>
<p>• “I love you, and I have boundaries.”</p>
