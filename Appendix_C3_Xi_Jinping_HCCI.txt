R         || Reach                  || 1 × 10⁹   || Domestic population + global influence (Belt & Road, UN)
C         || Cognitive Penetration  || 0.8       || Deep indoctrination via schools, propaganda, media
S         || Structural Penetration || 1.0       || Direct control over party, state, military, law

T         || Network Amplifier      || 3.0       || Maximum position in China’s info-structural network
Formula:
EOI = (R × C × S × F × I × L) ^ T
= (10⁹ × 0.8 × 1.0 × 4380 × 800 × 1000) ^ 3
≈ 2.2 × 10^55

Conclusion: Xi Jinping’s EOI reaches ~2.2 × 10^55, an extreme value in the model, indicating empire-level structural amplification.
