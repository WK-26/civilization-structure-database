<hr />
<p>üß≠ From a Civilizational Perspective:</p>
<hr />
<p>What does Steve Jobs‚Äô civilizational impact mean? 1. Elevated civilizational aesthetic standards He integrated beauty into industrial products, philosophy into technology, and placed ‚Äúhumanity‚Äù at the core of technological development. 2. Created memetic templates ‚ÄúChange the world‚Äù was not just a slogan, but a behavioral paradigm replicated by entrepreneurs worldwide. 3. Released individual creativity Through his products and ideas, he reinforced the social position of ‚Äúcreators,‚Äù becoming a representative figure of ‚Äúempowering individuals.‚Äù 4. Also introduced certain structural risks Such as the worship of perfectionism and the imitation of authoritative leadership styles (the myth of ‚ÄúJobs-style management‚Äù), which were amplified in the RUI.</p>
<hr />
<p>‚∏ª</p>
<hr />
<p>üß† In summary:</p>
<hr />
<p>Steve Jobs was not a perfect saint, but he was one of the powerful engines driving human civilizational leaps forward. He was a low-cancer, high-function, high-diffusion, high-impact super civilizational catalyst.</p>
