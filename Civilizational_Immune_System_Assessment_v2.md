Ⅰ    Conceptual Definition
The so-called Civilizational Immune System Assessment Method refers to:
A systematic framework for diagnosing the internal structures and external expansion patterns of major global civilizations, modeled on the logic of biological immune systems, with the aim of screening for the following risks:
Hidden mechanisms of structural control
Reverse assimilation risks (civilizations devouring their conquerors)
Tendencies of freedom erosion
Cultural spillover and structural expansionism
A civilization’s capacity to resist the global unification trap
The health of resource-reproduction-population structures
The degree ofprotection for individual life and human dignity
In simple terms:
This is a  “ virus screening ”   and  “ structural immunity ”   tool for human civilization, designed to help humanity identify hidden threats embedded
within cultural structures, and to prevent global civilization from falling into  a  superficially  unified  yet   fundamentally  rigid   and  manipulated system trap.

Ⅱ Operational Procedure
step1.Civilizational Immune System - Seven Core Indicators Definition
1. Family-Power Structure Transparency
Assesses how much the family structure contributes to power
concentration, resource monopoly, and early-stage social
domestication. High transparency indicates weak familial
authoritarian tendencies and respect for individual autonomy from birth.
2. Freedom of Thought & Information
Measures the level of freedom of speech, press, academic
research, and access to uncensored information. High freedom ensures self-correction capacity and social resilience.
3. Cultural Expansion Mode Transparency
Evaluates whether a civilization's external cultural influence is based on voluntary attraction or hidden structural infiltration.
Transparent expansion implies respect for diversity and reduced risk of reverse assimilation.
4. Sincerity in Global Cooperation
Analyzes the degree of genuine cooperation in international
relations, versus exploitative or manipulative engagement. High    sincerity indicates constructive participation in global governance.
5. Internal Self-Correction
Examines the civilization's ability to recognize and address internal flaws through democratic mechanisms, critical reflection, and
institutional reform. Strong self-correction prevents structural rigidity and collapse.
6. Reproductive-Resource Structure Health
Assesses whether population reproduction and resource
distribution are based on love, autonomy, and equity, rather than bloodline obsession, gender control, or structural anxiety.
7. Protection of Life & Dignity
Evaluates the real level of individual protection, including legal rights, bodily autonomy, and defense against systemic
dehumanization. High protection reflects respect for human dignity over structural interests.
Step 2: Data Scoring & Global Civilizational Assessment
Detailed Scoring Criteria for the Seven Core Indicators
1. Family-Power Structure Transparency
•     16-20 points:  Clear boundaries between  family and state power; bloodline does not equate to resources or social status.
•     11-15 points: Family influence exists but is limited; individuals can break through via merit.
•    6-10 points:  Family  ties  and nepotism widely dominate resource distribution.
•    0-5  points:  Bloodline   and   family  structure  dictate  everything; social resources are entirely hijacked by privatized power.
⸻
2. Freedom ofThought & Information
•     16-20 points: High protection of free speech, media, education, and dissenting opinions.
•     11-15 points: Some areas of contention; mainstream freedom exists but dissent faces certain risks.
•    6-10 points:  Minimal  space  for dissent; information is controlled by the state or power groups.
•    0-5   points:   Total   ideological   control;   media,   education,   and
information are completely sealed.
⸻
3. Cultural Expansion Mode Transparency
•     16-20 points: External cultural exchanges are open and equal, with no hidden infiltration tendencies.
•     11-15  points:   Cultural  diffusion  includes  partial  value   export; manageable controversy exists.
•    6-10 points: Cultural output accompanied by structural control and identity infiltration.
•    0-5 points: Culture functions as a tool for assimilation and control; severe reverse assimilation of external societies.
⸻
4. Structural Sincerity in Global Cooperation
•     16-20 points: Active participation in global governance; respects rules; transparent cooperation.
•     11-15 points: Cooperation includes interest struggles; rule-setting shows signs of double standards.
•    6-10  points:  Cooperation  involves  structural  coercion  and  rule
manipulation.
•    0-5     points:    Superficial    cooperation     disguises     infiltration, subversion, and rule plundering.
⸻
5. Internal Self-Correction & Critical Reflection
•     16-20 points: Broad mechanisms for self-reflection; historical and present problems can be openly discussed and reformed.
•     11-15 points:  Space  for  criticism  exists;  structural  problems  are partially concealed.
•    6-10   points:   Self-criticism   mechanisms   are   largely   nominal; problems are systematically covered up.
•    0-5 points:  Absolute  self-deification;  all  reflection  and  criticism strictly prohibited.
⸻
6. Resource-Reproduction-Population Structure Health
•     16-20  points:   Freedom   in  reproductive  choices;   fair  resource distribution; high gender equality.
•     11-15 points: Anxiety exists over reproduction and resources, but
no severe structural crisis.
•    6-10   points:    Reproduction    and    resources    are     structurally instrumentalized; women and families face severe control.
•    0-5 points:  Reproduction  is  fully  instrumentalized;  resource  and population structures exhibit high authoritarianism.
⸻
7. Protection ofLife & Individual Dignity
•     16-20  points:  Strong  protection  of  life   and  dignity;  legal   and cultural systems uphold human value.
•     11-15 points: Legal protections broadly in place; individual dignity fluctuates under cultural influence.
•    6-10 points:  Weak protection  of life  and dignity; individuals  are easily sacrificed by the system.
•    0-5 points: Individuals have no value; life and dignity are entirely structurally dissolved.
