# Appendix A1: China (High Cancerous Structure + Strong External Spillover)

1. Overview
•	FFI = 15.7 / 100 (very low functional health structure)
•	CSI = 83.0 / 100 (very high cancerous structure)
•	CHS = -63.7 (overall health score is negative)
•	EOI = 0.8 (very high external output capacity, mainly via economy, technology, and discourse power)
•	RUI = 66.4 (significant reverse unification risk)
•	HCCI = -44.6 (net negative contribution to global civilization)

### Interpretation:
China exhibits a dual pattern of internal cancerization and external expansion. Internally, information systems, legal frameworks, and value structures are heavily centralized and suppress individual freedom, critical thinking, and innovation. Externally, China projects its structural control model through capital, supply chains, technology standards, and narrative influence, creating a “reverse unification” effect on global systems.

1. Detailed Scores for the Seven Systems

Each system contains 10 positive FFI indicators (0–5 points each) and 5 negative CSI indicators (0–5 points each), converted into a 0–100 scale.

⸻

1. 1 Information & Neural System
•	FFI = 10 / 100
### Rationale:
- •	Press Freedom: 0/5 (China ranks 172/180 on the RSF Press Freedom Index)

Any existence that refuses to recognize the immune principle
walks toward cancer and self-destruction.

任何拒绝免疫原理的存在，必然走向癌化与自毁。
