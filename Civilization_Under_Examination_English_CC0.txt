Preface: The Illusion of Civilization and the Absence of Structure
Human civilization appears to be advancing toward unprecedented prosperity.
Skyscrapers rise, technology accelerates, the Internet floods every corner of the world with information and ideas, and globalization blurs the boundaries between nations, cultures, and communities. It seems we are living in the most open, free, and diverse era in human history.
But pause for a moment. Look closely.
Beneath this illusion of prosperity, hidden cracks are rapidly expanding.
There is more information, yet truth is harder to find.
There is more wealth, yet inequality deepens.
Institutions grow complex, yet societies become anxious.
Ideas multiply, yet individuals feel more isolated, confused, and angry.
Technology grows stronger, yet civilization itself spirals out of control like a beast without direction.
This is not alarmism.
This is reality.
Human civilization resembles a body that appears strong on the surface but is riddled with hidden structural disorders.
We claim to be progressing, yet we have lost the ability to assess the true health of our civilization.
We hide behind technological breakthroughs, economic growth, and political mobilization, masking deep-rooted structural flaws.
We indulge in superficial prosperity, yet rarely examine the internal structure of civilization or ask whether this system can bear the weight of its own expansion and conflict.
This uncomfortable truth must be spoken.
Civilization is not merely a pile of institutions, cultures, and technologies.
What determines the life or death of civilization is its structure.
Just like the human body, only when structure is coordinated, systems are aligned, and functions are balanced, can true health be sustained.
If information cannot flow freely, resources are unfairly distributed, foreign cultures cannot be healthily integrated, generations cannot be passed on with dignity, power cannot be effectively restrained, civilization lacks clear values, and worst of all, we lose the ability to resist internal and external risks—
Then no matter how prosperous civilization looks on the surface, it is a hollow shell awaiting collapse.
And today, humanity is repeating this dangerous cycle.
The greatest crisis of our time is not war, not economic recession, not even the unchecked advance of technology.
It is the structural imbalance and systemic chaos of civilization.
Fragmented thinking, drifting institutions, lost values, generational ruptures, cultural assimilation traps, power abuse, information manipulation, social numbness…
All these seemingly disconnected problems share a common root cause:
Civilization has lost its structure.
This book is not about creating new ideological slogans.
It is not about joining the endless noise of competing intellectual schools.
It is about doing one simple but essential thing:
Giving human civilization a systematic, structural health check.
I propose that civilization, like the human body, is a complex system that requires clear, coordinated, and healthy structure.
This structure consists of seven core systems:
1.	Information-Nervous System: Freedom of Thought and Information Mechanisms
2.	Resource Circulation System: Fair Distribution and Economic Structure
3.	Absorption and Integration System: Healthy Assimilation and Civilizational Boundaries
4.	Healthy Reproduction and Structural Inheritance: Against Bloodline Tyranny and Generational Health
5.	Legal and Institutional Framework: Checks and Balances and Social Order
6.	Human Values and Direction: Preventing Confusion and Extremes
7.	Immune System: Structural Risk Identification and Resistance
These seven systems determine whether civilization operates healthily, whether humanity can escape chaos, and whether we can truly achieve freedom and dignity.
In this book, I will:
✅ Systematically explain the logic of the seven structural systems
✅ Categorize human civilizational achievements and classic theories
✅ Conduct a comprehensive health check to expose structural risks
✅ Propose pathways for optimizing civilization and ensuring its healthy evolution
This is not utopian fantasy.
It does not shy away from the ugliness of reality.
I am fully aware that this path will not be easy.
The problems of civilization run deeper than any war, coup, or economic crisis.
But if we refuse to face them, refuse to reflect, refuse to conduct this structural health check, the outcome is inevitable:
Structural collapse. Systemic failure.
And with it, the erosion of every illusion of prosperity, freedom, and dignity.
That is why I write this book.
It is both a structural reflection and a difficult attempt at self-rescue.
Civilization is sick.
Without a systematic health check, humanity has no future.

Chapter 9: My Proposal for a New Human Civilization (Detailed Outline)
1. Why Humanity Needs a Complete “New Civilization” Blueprint
1.1 The Structural Collapse of the Old Civilization Is Irreversible
•	The Seven Core Systems are unbalanced, civilizational structure is fragile, immune systems have failed
•	Isolated fixes in technology, institutions, and culture are no longer effective
1.2 No Single Civilization Can Provide a Fully Healthy Structure
•	Every single cultural, institutional, or value system contains inherent limitations and blind spots
•	A holistic new civilization design based on structural logic is urgently needed
2. Structural Framework of the “New Human Civilization” Proposal
2.1 Clear Structure: Coordinated Design of the Seven Core Systems
•	Each system has clearly defined functions and health standards
•	Systems operate in coordinated, stable interaction, avoiding internal conflict and loss of control
2.2 System Coordination: Civilizational Systems Operate as an Integrated Whole
•	Information, resources, culture, generations, institutions, values, and immunity form an interlinked structure
•	Avoid single-point breakthroughs that trigger systemic risks
•	Ensure the civilization evolves healthily instead of collapsing structurally
2.3 Structural Boundaries: Preventing Structural Distortion and Power Abuse
•	Clearly define system boundaries, power boundaries, and cultural boundaries
•	Prevent new rounds of authoritarianism and alienation disguised as “structural optimization”
3. How to Avoid Extremes and Self-Destruction Within Civilization
3.1 Opposing Structural Worship and Technological Instrumentalism
•	Structure is a necessary condition for health, but not the ultimate goal
•	Technology must remain subordinate to human values, never reversing to control civilization itself
3.2 Guarding Against Pseudo-Civilization Infiltration and Cultural Manipulation
•	Structural design must include robust immune mechanisms
•	Defend against false freedom, false equality, extreme nationalism, and cultural assimilation traps
3.3 Love, Freedom, and Dignity as Core Civilizational Constraints
•	All structural optimization must be built upon safeguarding individual and collective dignity
•	Love, freedom, and dignity cannot be instrumentalized or marginalized
4. Combining Realistic Pathways with Long-Term Civilizational Vision
4.1 Realistic Pathway: Gradual Structural Reconstruction
•	Step-by-step optimization of six key areas: information mechanisms, institutional boundaries, cultural integration, generational structure, value consensus, and immune systems
•	Promote prototypes of the new civilization through policy, education, technology, and global cooperation
4.2 Long-Term Vision: A New Civilization with Structural Stability, Systemic Health, and Clear Values
•	Highly coordinated internal civilization, systems operating in healthy cycles
•	Systematic guarantees for individual dignity, social freedom, cultural boundaries, and diversity
•	A civilization that no longer self-destructs, alienates, or descends into extremism and collapse
5. Conclusion: The New Civilization Is the Only Rational Escape from Structural Collapse
•	The collapse of the old civilizational structure is inevitable
•	The new civilization blueprint is not utopian fantasy, but a realistic, logic-driven solution based on health diagnostics and structural design
•	Only with a new civilization can humanity truly deserve love, freedom, and dignity, break free from chaos and fear, and embark on a path toward health and dignity
Chapter 10: The Blueprint for a New Human Civilization
Section 1: Where Should Civilization Ultimately Go?
Throughout history, human civilization has run like a chaotic marathon:
From survival to security, from order to power, from tools to technology, from tribes to systems.
But somewhere along the race, we lost the destination and only remembered the road.
We forgot people and worshiped efficiency.
We forgot freedom and surrendered to control.
We forgot love and clung to rigid structures.
Now, standing at the edge of structural collapse, we must return to the most essential question:
Where is humanity truly going?
1.1 The end of history should not be collapse or control—it must be structural evolution
The future of civilization must not be extinction.
Nor should it be a totalitarian utopia where algorithms rule and freedom vanishes.
True civilizational progress is not about perfecting tools of obedience,
but about creating healthier structures of freedom.
Not systems of tighter control, but systems that respect life, dignity, and diversity.
If we keep repackaging broken institutions with new technologies,
if we only use stronger algorithms to prop up fragile systems,
then this road will lead only to extinction.
The end of civilization should not be a smarter form of slavery,
but a structurally mature, internally coherent, and value-driven community of life.
That is why we now propose a new blueprint for human civilization—
Not a patchwork of policies or a technocratic fix,
but a return to the fundamental questions:
Why do we organize as humans?
What are we living for?
And what does a real future even mean?
1.2 The true purpose of civilization:
To ensure that every human life is filled with love, freedom, and dignity
Civilization is not built to create supermachines—
It must exist to ensure ordinary people are no longer crushed.
It is not meant to generate endless data—
But to ensure that each person is born without fear, speaks without censorship,
lives with meaning, and dies with peace.
The success of civilization is not measured by GDP or the number of rockets launched.
It is measured by:
•	Whether children still want to be born into this world.
•	Whether the elderly are respectfully embraced at the end of life.
•	Whether, in quiet moments, people feel not fear, but the genuine meaning of being alive.
When we say “civilization must be rebuilt,”
we are not rebuilding a tower, a regime, or an empire.
We are rebuilding a way of life—
a structure that honors the essence of being human.
We are not constructing a perfect heaven—
We are asking:
Can humanity finally become worthy of civilization?
Chapter 1: Why Civilization Requires Structural Design
At first glance, human civilization appears more prosperous than ever.
Skyscrapers reshape the skyline, technology advances at lightning speed, information and ideas flood the world, and waves of philosophies, theories, cultures, and institutions seem to pour in endlessly.
It feels like we are living in an era of unprecedented freedom, rationality, openness, and inclusiveness.
But pause for a moment, look closer—
Behind this dazzling surface lies deep absurdity.
Section 1: The Illusion of Civilization — Structural Crisis Behind Prosperity
Walk through any modern metropolis today, and it feels like humanity is living in its most glorious era.
Skyscrapers tower above the cityscape, subways shuttle millions daily, shopping malls glow with prosperity, the Internet connects billions in real time, and breakthroughs in space exploration, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology make headlines almost weekly.
From New York to Shanghai, from Dubai to Singapore, globalization and technological progress seem to have brought humanity to an unprecedented pinnacle.
Many therefore believe that civilization is steadily advancing toward a future of “freedom, prosperity, and reason.”
But if you pause for a moment and look beneath the surface, you’ll see deep, growing cracks hidden within this facade.
What appears to be prosperity is, in reality, a structural illusion — not genuine systemic health.
1.1 Technology and the Economy: A Double-Edged Sword
There is no denying that rapid technological advancement and economic growth have driven an explosion in human productivity.
Case Study: The Rise of Artificial Intelligence and Automation
Over the past decade, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, and machine learning have been widely adopted, dramatically increasing production efficiency and spawning new industries.
In fields like healthcare, finance, and manufacturing, AI has lowered costs and improved efficiency.
At first glance, it feels like humanity is entering a new, intelligent era.
Strengths:
•	Labor productivity liberated, some tedious tasks reduced
•	New industries foster innovation and convenience
•	Technological breakthroughs fuel economic growth
Weaknesses and Risks:
•	Technology accelerates capital concentration, deepening wealth inequality
•	Automation eliminates vast numbers of jobs, especially for vulnerable populations
•	Algorithmic monopolies erode information transparency and social fairness
•	Technology lacks clear value boundaries, leading to data abuse, privacy violations, and social control risks
Behind the surface prosperity of technology lies severe structural imbalance and hidden social crises.
1.2 The False Prosperity of “Information Freedom”
Superficially, the Internet has made information more free than ever before.
Social media, search engines, and online platforms theoretically allow anyone to express themselves and access information.
Case Study: Social Media Polarization
Platforms like Twitter, TikTok, Facebook, and Weibo boast billions of users and extremely low barriers to publishing.
This appears to be the pinnacle of information democratization.
Strengths:
•	Drastically lowers the cost of information dissemination
•	Makes knowledge more accessible to ordinary people
•	Raises public awareness of social events and issues
Weaknesses and Risks:
•	Algorithmic recommendation traps users in ideological echo chambers
•	Disinformation spreads rapidly, fueling global manipulation of public opinion
•	Extremism, conspiracy theories, and populism flourish on these platforms
•	Platform monopolies control information flow and public perception
The illusion of information freedom conceals the reality of manipulation, social fragmentation, and cognitive crisis.
1.3 The Double-Edged Nature of Globalization
Globalization is often seen as a hallmark of modern civilization.
The transnational flow of goods, capital, people, and technology has fueled economic development and cultural exchange.
Case Study: Global Supply Chains and Economic Interdependence
From smartphones to electric vehicles, from fast fashion to high-end semiconductors, global supply chains enable efficient international cooperation and mutual dependence.
Strengths:
•	Increases production efficiency, lowers consumer costs
•	Enriches cultural exchange and partial knowledge sharing
•	Accelerates technological progress and industrial upgrading
Weaknesses and Risks:
•	Core resources, technologies, and profits concentrated in the hands of a few global giants
•	Global supply chains are fragile, easily disrupted by pandemics, wars, or other crises
•	Cultural homogenization erodes local diversity and blurs civilizational boundaries
•	Economic globalization outpaces value and institutional globalization, accelerating social divisions
Beneath the surface prosperity of globalization lurk structural risks and growing fragility.
1.4 The Illusion of Institutional Diversity
On the surface, the modern world boasts a diversity of institutional models:
Capitalism, socialism, mixed economies, democracy, authoritarianism, religious governance — multiple systems coexist.
In theory, this institutional diversity fosters innovation.
But in reality, it reflects structural fragmentation and imbalance.
Case Study: The China-U.S. Model Comparison
China: A hybrid of centralization and market forces enables short-term efficiency and economic growth. But structurally, power is monopolized, information is tightly controlled, and social freedoms are constrained.
The United States: Democracy and markets coexist. In theory, the system is open and transparent. In reality, capital hijacks democracy, political polarization deepens, and social cohesion unravels.
Summary:
What appears as diversity conceals:
•	A lack of systematic structural design, leading to internal risks in all models
•	No unified structural framework, making global cooperation difficult
•	Coexistence of authoritarianism, pseudo-freedom, and extreme capitalism, leaving global civilization in a state of severe imbalance
1.5 The Illusion of Prosperity Is Ultimately a Structural Deficiency
Technological advancement, information explosion, globalization, and institutional diversity are all real achievements of human civilization.
But without systemic structural support, these achievements inevitably transform into new risks and crises.
Without structure, prosperity is an illusion.
Without structure, civilization spirals out of control.
Without structure, civilization not only fails to progress — it accelerates toward collapse.
End of Section 1
Section 2: Fragmented Civilization — Marching Toward Self-Destruction
Humanity has long believed that diversity within civilization equates to security.
A diversity of ideas, theories, systems, and cultures is often seen as a symbol of vitality and progress.
But without structural integration and clear boundaries, this so-called “diversity” inevitably devolves into dangerous fragmentation.
And the final outcome of a fragmented civilization is inevitable: self-destruction.
2.1 Intellectual Fragmentation
At first glance, the intellectual world appears to be more “diverse” than ever.
An endless array of philosophies, theories, and ideologies flood the public sphere:
Liberalism, conservatism, Marxism, nationalism, technological utopianism, nihilism, identity politics…
But these schools of thought do not coexist in harmony. They conflict, negate, and attack each other, creating profound cognitive division across society.
Case Study: Postmodernism and the Collapse of Shared Truth
The rise of postmodernist thought emphasized deconstructing authority and questioning power structures, which indeed challenged outdated dogmas.
Strengths:
•	Critiqued traditional hierarchies and dominant narratives
•	Raised public awareness of power dynamics
•	Encouraged more diverse expression of ideas
Weaknesses and Risks:
•	Excessive deconstruction eroded the very concept of truth and fact
•	Relativism flourished, leading to “everyone has their own truth”
•	Social consensus collapsed, rational discourse space shrank, and cognitive fragmentation intensified
Ultimately, intellectual fragmentation did not lead to true freedom — only unprecedented confusion and division.
2.2 Institutional Patchwork
Faced with the shocks of globalization and technological change, nations have increasingly adopted “patchwork” institutional models.
Borrowing bits and pieces from different systems, they create superficially functional, but structurally unstable governance frameworks.
Case Study: China’s “Political Centralization + Market Economy” Model
China forcibly fused a highly centralized political system with elements of market economics, achieving impressive short-term growth.
Strengths:
•	Centralization enabled rapid policy implementation
•	Market mechanisms unleashed economic potential
•	The nation experienced rapid economic rise in the global market
Weaknesses and Risks:
•	Inherent tension between political structure and economic logic
•	Centralized power suppresses innovation and social vitality
•	Economic dependency on global markets clashes with domestic political closure
What appears to be efficient and prosperous on the surface conceals dangerous structural imbalances.
Case Study: Latin America’s “Pseudo-Democracy + Weak State” Trap
Many Latin American nations adopted formal democratic institutions, yet their hollow, fragmented power structures left them mired in poverty, instability, and social violence.
Institutional patchwork ultimately produces instability and civilizational regression.
2.3 Value Deconstruction and Alienation
In the wake of fragmentation, even humanity’s core values face systemic breakdown.
Case 1: Freedom Reduced to Consumerism
“Freedom” was once a cornerstone of human civilization, yet under rampant consumerism, it has been degraded into:
•	Freedom to choose products replacing genuine political and social freedoms
•	Consumption levels becoming symbols of social status, deepening inequality
•	Market logic, dominated by capital, suppressing true individual freedom
Case 2: Technology Becomes a Tool of Control
Technology, originally intended to advance civilization, has been distorted into:
•	Data surveillance and algorithmic manipulation eroding information freedom
•	Technological monopolies empowering capital and authoritarian control
•	Technological development detached from human values, fueling social alienation
Case 3: Love and Dignity Are Marginalized
In fragmented civilization, love, freedom, and dignity — the foundations of civilization — are systematically marginalized and instrumentalized:
•	Love reduced to a commodity in the entertainment economy
•	Freedom warped into the illusion of “choice” under consumerism
•	Dignity eroded by structural inequality and systemic oppression
The result: the very value system of civilization disintegrates, plunging human society into spiritual emptiness.
2.4 Without Structure, Civilization Devours Itself
Fragmentation is not diversity.
It is a harbinger of systemic collapse.
A civilization lacking structural integration and boundary design faces:
•	Intellectual disintegration, making truth and consensus impossible
•	Institutional chaos, leaving society deeply unstable
•	Value alienation, draining the civilization’s spiritual vitality
Such a civilization cannot coordinate itself, cannot evolve healthily, and ultimately descends into:
Self-division → Uncontrolled internal conflict → Structural collapse → Civilizational self-destruction
This is not abstract theory. It is a recurring tragedy throughout human history:
•	The Roman Empire’s later years were marked by institutional collapse and cultural alienation, hastening its fall
•	The Soviet Union’s terminal phase saw complete disintegration of ideology and governance, accelerating its collapse
•	Today, the free world suffers structural disintegration, enabling extremism and nihilism to resurface globally
If humanity continues to neglect structural design, civilization will inevitably fragment, decay, and destroy itself.
End of Section 2
Section 3: Structure Determines the Fate of Civilization
The rise and fall of civilization has never been solely a question of technological progress, economic prosperity, or intellectual freedom.
What truly determines the destiny of any civilization is one fundamental factor: structure.
A civilization lacking clear, healthy, and coordinated structural design may experience fleeting prosperity, innovation, and diversity on the surface.
But beneath the surface, uncontrolled fragmentation and systemic conflict will inevitably accumulate, driving the civilization toward chaos, collapse, and ultimately, self-destruction.
Structure is the foundation for sustainable civilizational evolution, the capacity to resist internal and external risks, and the realization of both individual dignity and social stability.
3.1 What Is Structure?
Structure defines the coordination of all elements within civilization.
It determines the internal division of labor, cooperation, and boundaries across:
•	How thought circulates freely, and how information is filtered and shared
•	How resources are distributed fairly, and how the economy circulates and regenerates
•	How foreign civilizations are absorbed, and how cultural boundaries and autonomy are preserved
•	How generational relationships function, and how reproduction avoids tyranny and demographic collapse
•	How power is balanced, and how institutions operate effectively
•	How values and direction are defined, preventing civilizational drift and extremism
•	How risks are identified, and how pseudo-civilizations are effectively resisted
Without structure, these elements inevitably conflict, undermine each other, and trigger systemic failure.
3.2 Civilization as a Complex System: The Human Body Analogy
Human society is fundamentally a complex system, operating under principles remarkably similar to the human body.
Case Study: Comparing Bodily Systems to Civilizational Structure
Just as the human body cannot survive without complete, healthy, and coordinated structures, civilization collapses without structural integrity.
3.3 The Seven Core Systems: The Structural Foundation of Civilization
Civilization is not an abstract ideal. It is a concrete structural system composed of seven essential, interconnected subsystems:
1.	Information-Nervous System: Guarantees free thought, information transparency, and cognitive coordination
2.	Resource Circulation System: Ensures fair resource distribution and rational economic structure
3.	Absorption and Integration System: Filters and absorbs foreign civilizations, preserving cultural boundaries and autonomy
4.	Healthy Reproduction and Structural Inheritance: Prevents bloodline tyranny, ensures positive generational cycles
5.	Legal and Institutional Framework: Establishes power balance, social order, and institutional stability
6.	Human Values and Direction: Clarifies civilizational goals, prevents value drift and extremism
7.	Immune System: Systematically identifies structural risks, resists pseudo-civilizations and authoritarian infiltration
Only when these seven systems are jointly constructed and operate in coordinated harmony can a civilization possess genuine health, stability, and self-repair capabilities.
3.4 Historical Warnings: How Structure Determines the Rise and Fall of Civilizations
Throughout history, every major civilizational collapse has been the inevitable result of structural imbalance:
Case Study 1: The Structural Collapse of the Roman Empire
•	Economy depended on slavery, undermining the resource circulation system
•	Political corruption destroyed power balance and institutional stability
•	Massive foreign migrations erased cultural boundaries
•	Value drift and spiritual exhaustion hollowed out society
Despite its once-great prosperity, Rome disintegrated under the weight of systemic structural failure.
Case Study 2: The Structural Disintegration of the Soviet Union
•	Planned economy and centralized political structure generated severe internal tension
•	Information blockade led to intellectual stagnation and innovation collapse
•	Generational imbalance and loss of youth trust eroded social cohesion
•	Immune system failure left the system vulnerable to both internal and external collapse
The Soviet Union’s demise was not merely an economic or ideological failure, but the inevitable outcome of structural disintegration.
3.5 Structure Determines the Fate of Civilization
Temporary prosperity may conceal structural flaws.
Technological breakthroughs cannot compensate for structural deficiencies.
Institutional patchwork cannot offset systemic imbalance.
If civilization is to achieve genuine health, it must return to structural fundamentals:
•	Structure determines whether a civilization’s internal systems can coordinate
•	Structure determines a civilization’s capacity for risk resistance and self-repair
•	Structure determines whether civilization can support love, freedom, and dignity — or descend into alienation, division, and self-destruction
Without structure, civilization is condemned to cyclical failure, endlessly oscillating between prosperity and collapse.
Structural design is the only rational path for civilization to mature and evolve healthily.
End of Section 3
Section 4: Why Without Structure, Civilization Is Doomed to Repeated Failure
Throughout history, human civilization has repeatedly cycled through phases of prosperity and collapse.
The rise and fall of ancient empires, the replacement of modern institutions, the ups and downs of technological revolutions—
Each time, civilization seems to advance, yet inevitably descends into chaos, extremism, and self-destruction.
Why?
Because civilization has consistently lacked clear, complete, and healthy structural design.
Without structure, civilization inevitably falls into the dual trap of authoritarianism and chaos, endlessly repeating its failures, unable to break free.
4.1 Ancient Closure and Tyranny: The Fragility of Monolithic Structures
Most ancient civilizations relied on extreme centralization and cultural uniformity to maintain superficial stability.
Case Study: China’s Feudal Imperial System
China’s ancient empires built seemingly powerful state structures through absolute imperial authority, rigid bloodline legitimacy, and aggressive cultural assimilation.
Strengths:
•	Centralized power enabled high short-term mobilization efficiency
•	Cultural uniformity fostered superficial social stability
•	Agricultural economic structure suited low-technology survival needs
Weaknesses and Risks:
•	Excessively monolithic structure lacked internal diversity and self-repair mechanisms
•	Innovation and intellectual freedom were systematically suppressed
•	Society became rigid and unable to adapt to external shocks
•	When power or resource systems collapsed, the entire civilization imploded
Outcome:
China’s seemingly powerful feudal system crumbled rapidly under the impact of the Opium Wars and the industrial revolution, exposing the extreme fragility of single-structure civilizations.
4.2 Modern Freedom Distorted: Structural Emptiness Breeds Self-Destruction
In modern times, civilization appears more diverse and free.
But lacking systematic design and structural coordination, freedom and diversity quickly distort, accelerating civilizational breakdown.
Case Study: Structural Crisis in Contemporary Western Societies
Western nations possess democratic institutions, rule of law, and theoretical freedom of thought, yet:
•	Capital has hijacked democracy, rendering power balance hollow
•	Media and information structures are imbalanced, fueling extremism
•	Social welfare and economic structures are disconnected, deepening class divisions
•	Value systems have disintegrated, with nihilism and consumerism corroding civilizational foundations
The result: the once-progressive “freedom model” now faces:
•	Political polarization and institutional hollowing
•	Social fragmentation and rampant identity politics
•	Resurgent nationalism and false freedom ideologies
Without structure, freedom and diversity inevitably mutate into chaos and collapse.
4.3 The Dual Trap of Authoritarianism and Chaos
Civilizations lacking structural design inevitably oscillate between two extremes:
Extreme 1: Captured by Authoritarianism
•	Structural absence leads to systemic failure and social panic
•	Individuals, desperate for security, empower authoritarian forces
•	Superficial short-term stability conceals power monopolies, intellectual suffocation, and innovation collapse
•	Ultimately, civilization implodes from internal repression and rigidity
Extreme 2: Devoured by Chaos
•	Without structure, societies spiral into ideological division and institutional disorder
•	Extreme freedom, consumerism, and populism flourish
•	Social consensus dissolves, order collapses, and civilization loses direction
•	Ultimately, civilization self-destructs through anarchy and extremism
These two extremes are not opposites — they are both inevitable consequences of structural absence.
Unless civilization undergoes structural reconstruction, it is condemned to endlessly struggle between authoritarianism and chaos, incapable of healthy evolution.
4.4 The Historical Death Cycle of Structural Failure
Looking back across human history:
•	Late Roman Empire: Institutional decay and structural fragmentation triggered imperial collapse
•	Medieval Europe: Religious authoritarianism and structural closure trapped civilization in centuries of stagnation
•	20th Century Soviet Union: Structural rigidity and information blockade led to systemic disintegration
•	Contemporary Free World: Structural hollowness and value distortion fuel social fragmentation and institutional failure
Regardless of region, system, or culture, all ultimately fall victim to the same death cycle of structural failure.
Civilization cannot “naturally evolve” into a healthy structure through experience alone.
Active, systematic structural design is the only way out.
4.5 Without Structure, Civilization Is Doomed to Repeated Failure
No matter how prosperous, technologically advanced, or institutionally complete a civilization appears—
Without comprehensive, healthy, and coordinated structural design, failure is only a matter of time.
Civilization will endlessly:
•	Swing between authoritarianism and chaos
•	Cycle between prosperity and collapse
•	Clash between technological breakthroughs and social fragmentation
•	Oscillate between self-inflation and self-destruction
Only through systematic structural design can civilization escape this cycle of failure and embark on a path toward health, stability, and self-evolution.
End of Section 4
Section 5: The Mission of This Book — Rebuilding Civilization’s Structural Coordinates
Civilization is playing with fire at the edge of collapse.
On the surface, technology is advancing rapidly, information flows globally, productivity continues to rise — it appears humanity is entering an era of unprecedented prosperity and freedom.
Beneath the surface, structural fragmentation is accelerating:
Social division, institutional failure, value confusion, pseudo-civilization infiltration — civilization is dangerously out of balance, teetering on the brink of systemic failure.
History has proven repeatedly:
The more prosperous civilization appears without structural design, the more devastating its collapse will be.
The longer civilization neglects systemic diagnosis, the more hidden and lethal its risks become.
What humanity lacks today is a systematic, structural health standard and logical coordinate system for civilization.
That is precisely the purpose and mission of this book.
5.1 Ending Fragmentation: Systematic Classification and Structural Analysis
The true crisis of civilization has never been isolated to technology, institutions, or the economy —
It is a problem of holistic structural imbalance.
In the face of fragmented ideas, theories, institutions, cultures, and classics,
This book will:
•	Use the framework of the Seven Core Civilizational Systems to systematically classify all major civilizational achievements and risks
•	Accurately assign classic theories, institutional models, and cultural products to their proper structural domains
•	Dismantle the illusion of fragmentation and restore the overall logic of civilization
Only by doing so can we overcome ideological chaos, institutional failure, and civilizational self-destruction.
5.2 No Utopian Fantasies: Confronting Reality, Exposing Structural Risks
This is not a book of naive idealism.
It does not flatter any civilization, nation, or ideology.
This book is grounded in sober, brutal realities:
•	Structural defects within civilization are real — and far more severe than most imagine
•	Authoritarianism, chaos, false freedom, and cultural manipulation have infiltrated mainstream civilization at every level
•	Without structural design, civilization will inevitably spiral into large-scale, systemic collapse
Therefore, this book will:
•	Confront the systemic flaws within all major civilizations
•	Refuse to romanticize any particular system, model, or cultural group
•	Use structural logic to expose deep-rooted risks and pseudo-civilizational traps
Only by facing these dangers head-on can civilization hope for true self-repair.
5.3 A Comprehensive Health Check for Civilization
Like the human body, civilization requires regular health examinations.
This book will conduct a structural, systematic health check of civilization using the Seven Core Systems:
•	Which systems are healthy, and which are malfunctioning?
•	Which civilizational achievements promote systemic evolution, and which conceal structural traps?
•	What is the current overall health status of civilization?
•	Where are the key risk points, and how might collapse mechanisms develop?
This represents humanity’s first attempt to create a systematic civilizational health check model, offering both structural warnings and constructive recommendations.
5.4 The Ultimate Goal: Enabling Civilization to Grow Healthily — Not Self-Destruct
The purpose of this book is not to induce fear, nor to promote complacency.
It has only one goal:
To rebuild civilization’s structural coordinates and guide it toward health, stability, and self-evolution.
Specifically:
•	Ensure coordinated operation and structural stability across all Seven Core Systems
•	Restore proper functional roles for thought, institutions, culture, economy, values, and immune mechanisms
•	Establish love, freedom, and dignity as the non-negotiable foundations of civilizational structure
•	Equip civilization with the systemic ability to identify risks, resist pseudo-civilizations, and self-repair
I believe:
Only when civilization possesses a clear, healthy, and systematic structural foundation
Can humanity truly deserve love, freedom, and dignity
Can civilization break free from fragmentation, chaos, and self-destruction
And instead, grow healthily toward a more mature, rational future.

Chapter 2: Seven Fundamental Systems of Civilization
1. Information-Nervous System: Freedom of Thought and Information Mechanisms
1.1 System Function: The Central Nervous System for Civilizational Information and Thought
A civilization’s health depends not only on its material foundation but critically on its ability to circulate information and transmit thought.
The information-nervous system determines:
•	Whether society possesses authentic perception and cognitive coordination;
•	Whether groups can form shared understanding based on information, avoiding collective illusions;
•	Whether ideas have space to be expressed, challenged, and continuously drive innovation and self-correction.
This system functions much like the nervous network of a living organism:
•	Ensuring information is synchronized across different parts;
•	Maintaining overall coordination and responsiveness.
•	Without a healthy information system, civilization loses the ability to perceive, coordinate, and innovate—its structural vitality collapses.
History and current reality repeatedly prove:
The structural design of the information-nervous system determines whether civilization truly possesses “consciousness” or merely operates as a mechanical shell.
1.2 Typical Mechanisms and Products
The evolution of human civilization has produced several key mechanisms within the information-nervous system:
(1) Freedom of the Press
•	Breaks information monopolies and prevents power or capital from dominating public discourse;
•	In some relatively liberal systems, though flaws exist, media still serve functions of truth exposure and power oversight.
(2) Publishing System
•	Books and publications systematically circulate and accumulate knowledge and ideas;
•	The widespread adoption of printing technology marked a historical turning point in large-scale information dissemination.
(3) The Internet
•	Greatly expands information access and expression, breaking geographical and social barriers to form a global information network;
•	Social media and self-publishing platforms lower the threshold for participation, enhancing individual expression.
(4) Education System
•	Cultivates individuals’ ability to access, process, and express information, forming the foundation of the information system;
•	The level of public education directly determines a society’s overall cognitive resilience and information health.
(5) Freedom of Speech
•	Ensures space for thought expression, prevents cognitive stagnation, and supports civilization’s innovation and self-correction capacity.
1.3 Structural Risks
When poorly designed or manipulated, the information system becomes a structural weakness threatening civilization’s health:
(1) Information Manipulation and Censorship
•	In some highly centralized information environments, channels are systematically blocked;
•	The information defense systems of certain East Asian countries have long confined hundreds of millions within controlled information spaces, severely impairing authentic perception.
(2) Algorithm Traps and Technological Monopolies
•	Leading global platform companies use algorithm-driven mechanisms to control information flow, creating “information echo chambers”;
•	This fuels social polarization, extremism, and the proliferation of conspiracy theories.
(3) Public Opinion Extremism and Misinformation Epidemics
•	Fragmented, unreliable information leads to cognitive confusion and social distrust;
•	During crises in some highly liberal societies, widespread misinformation directly weakened social coordination and protective capacities.
(4) Structural Dependence from Technological Monopolies
•	Excessive concentration of global information infrastructure creates new structural inequalities and vulnerabilities;
•	Control over data, platforms, and information flow is increasingly held by a few corporations or nations, undermining systemic stability.
Summary
The information-nervous system determines whether civilization possesses the basic capacities for:
•	Authentic perception;
•	Cognitive coordination;
•	Thought expression and innovation.
Once the system is:
•	Monopolized by power, civilization descends into informational isolation and structural rigidity;
•	Distorted by technology, society fractures, extremism and misinformation thrive;
•	Lacking structural balance, civilization faces cognitive chaos and systemic collapse.
The information system is not merely a technical or policy issue—
It is a core structural element determining the cognitive health and ultimate destiny of human civilization.
2. Resource Circulation System: Fair Distribution and Economic Structure
2.1 System Function: Resource Flow, Wealth Creation, and Social Circulation
A civilization is not sustained by ideas and cognition alone but fundamentally depends on stable and healthy material circulation.
The resource circulation system is the structural network within civilization that:
•	Ensures acquisition, distribution, and regeneration of material resources;
•	Supports wealth creation, economic operation, and societal vitality;
•	Maintains fairness, stability, and metabolic capacity, providing the foundation for long-term civilizational evolution.
Without a healthy resource circulation system, civilization inevitably faces:
•	Resource misallocation and deepening social inequality;
•	Economic structural stagnation and loss of vitality;
•	Decline of metabolic functions, leading to systemic imbalance and eventual collapse.
In essence, the resource circulation system determines:
Whether a civilization can continuously generate wealth, ensure fair distribution, and promote structural renewal.
2.2 Typical Mechanisms and Products
Throughout history, human civilization has explored various resource circulation mechanisms:
(1) Market Economy
•	Resources flow through market competition, driving efficiency and innovation;
•	Reality: Some relatively liberal economies have stimulated technological breakthroughs and wealth accumulation through market mechanisms but also suffer from structural inequality.
(2) Planned Economy
•	The state centrally allocates resources to ensure basic supply and social fairness;
•	Reality: Certain countries have achieved rapid industrialization in specific historical stages through planned systems but face long-term efficiency and innovation challenges.
(3) Capitalist and Socialist Models
•	Capitalism emphasizes market dominance, leading to resource efficiency but widening wealth gaps;
•	Socialism prioritizes resource redistribution, promoting social fairness but often encountering structural limitations in innovation and vitality.
(4) Agricultural and Industrial Civilizations
•	In agricultural civilizations, resource circulation is slow but structurally stable;
•	Industrial civilizations dramatically accelerate production and resource flow but intensify structural imbalances and environmental risks.
(5) Globalized Resource Networks
•	Resource allocation transcends national borders, forming global production, consumption, and economic circulation systems;
•	Typical Example: Energy, food, technology, and supply chains exhibit deep global interdependence, bringing both opportunities and structural vulnerabilities.
2.3 Structural Risks
When the resource circulation system is structurally imbalanced, civilization faces profound crises:
(1) Wealth Gap and Resource Exploitation
•	Globally, resources and wealth are highly concentrated, with a small minority controlling vast resources;
•	Data: In recent years, the wealthiest 1% of the global population has controlled nearly half of the world’s wealth, exacerbating structural inequality.
(2) Economic Monopoly and Technological Distortion
•	Certain transnational capital groups and platform-based enterprises reshape resource allocation through control of key resources and technologies;
•	Markets appear free, but structural monopolies severely undermine fairness and innovation.
(3) Ecological Destruction and Unsustainable Development
•	Rapid economic growth based on resource overexploitation and environmental damage disrupts the entire resource circulation system;
•	Reality: Global climate crises, ecological degradation, and species extinction threaten civilization’s own development.
(4) Systemic Structural Mismatches
•	Resource circulation becomes hijacked by technological logic and capital interests, detached from social needs and structural balance;
•	Example: In certain countries, real estate bubbles and overexpansion of virtual economies severely distort resource flows, masking structural fragility behind false prosperity.
Summary
The resource circulation system is not merely an economic issue of efficiency and growth.
It fundamentally concerns civilization’s:
•	Structural fairness and stability;
•	Wealth creation and social vitality;
•	Long-term health and systemic resilience.
A healthy resource circulation system requires dynamic, balanced structural design between:
•	Market efficiency and social fairness;
•	Technological innovation and resource sustainability;
•	Economic activity and ecological integrity.
When imbalance occurs:
•	Resource plunder, structural monopolies, ecological destruction, and social fragmentation emerge simultaneously;
•	Civilization loses vitality, structural risks intensify, and systemic collapse and self-destruction become inevitable.
3. Assimilation and Integration System: Healthy Absorption and Civilizational Boundaries
3.1 System Function: Selective Absorption of External Culture, Institutions, and Technology
No civilization exists in complete isolation.
The vitality of any civilization depends on its ability to:
•	Selectively absorb external cultural, institutional, and technological elements;
•	Maintain clear cultural boundaries and structural resilience to prevent external erosion or forced assimilation;
•	Preserve core identity and institutional autonomy while participating in global openness and integration.
This process functions much like the digestive system of a living organism:
•	Efficiently absorbs beneficial external nutrients, transforming them into internal growth and advancement;
•	Simultaneously filters and rejects harmful or incompatible elements, safeguarding structural stability.
Without a healthy assimilation and integration system, external inputs lead not to progress but to structural disorder, identity collapse, and eventual loss of civilizational agency.
3.2 Typical Mechanisms and Manifestations
Throughout history, humanity has developed multiple mechanisms to balance absorption and boundary protection:
(1) Multiculturalism Policies
•	Parts of Western Europe have implemented multicultural policies aiming to foster innovation and social vitality;
•	Reality: While short-term cultural prosperity emerges, these policies often expose structural difficulties in migrant integration and identity conflict.
(2) Immigration Systems
•	A major North American power relies on skilled immigration and labor inflow to enhance competitiveness and economic growth;
•	However, mismanaged low-skilled immigration exacerbates social stratification and ethnic segregation.
(3) Cultural Exchange Mechanisms
•	Globally, academic, educational, and artistic platforms promote intercultural dialogue and understanding;
•	At the same time, cultural powerhouses leverage these mechanisms to export their values, subtly undermining weaker societies’ cultural independence.
(4) Globalization Process
•	Global population giants and economic powers deeply integrate into international economic and cultural networks;
•	While benefiting from development opportunities, they face growing risks of cultural homogenization and identity anxiety.
3.3 Structural Risks
When assimilation and integration systems lack structural balance and boundary safeguards, civilizations face severe risks:
(1) Cultural Hegemony and Assimilation Traps
•	A major North American power and certain technologically advanced East Asian nations utilize technology, capital, and cultural soft power to expand global influence;
•	Weaker civilizations, lacking boundary protection, see their core value systems eroded and autonomy gradually lost.
(2) Identity Anxiety and Social Fragmentation
•	In parts of Western Europe, the pace of cultural absorption has far outstripped social integration capacity, leading to:
•	Erosion of shared identity and intensified ethnic, religious, and cultural tensions;
•	Escalating extremism, ethnic segregation, and social polarization.
(3) Cultural Erosion and Structural Collapse
•	Under globalization, some resource-exporting nations and emerging economies, with weak cultural defense mechanisms, experience:
•	Collapse of traditional value systems and loss of social cohesion;
•	Institutional weakening and blurred civilizational boundaries.
(4) Integration Distorting into Structural Infiltration
•	Certain technological superpowers and leading global platform companies leverage data, cultural products, and technical standards to deeply penetrate other societies’ structures and institutions;
•	Beneath the surface of integration lies growing institutional dependency and structural control, steadily undermining the absorbed civilization’s agency.
Summary
Assimilation and integration systems are not merely cultural policies but critical structural foundations that determine whether a civilization can:
•	Effectively absorb external strengths to drive internal advancement;
•	Preserve cultural identity and structural resilience in the face of external influence;
•	Resist cultural hegemony, assimilation traps, and structural infiltration.
A healthy assimilation and integration system:
•	Facilitates civilizational upgrading and multicultural prosperity;
•	Maintains clear boundaries and cultural self-determination;
•	Shields against hidden structural risks beneath the surface of globalization and cooperation.
When this system collapses, civilizations inevitably fall into:
•	Identity disintegration;
•	Social polarization and cultural conflict;
•	Institutional weakening and the erosion of structural boundaries;
•	Ultimately, they lose their civilizational agency and capacity for healthy, autonomous development in an interconnected world.
4. Healthy Reproduction and Structural Inheritance: Resisting Bloodline Tyranny and Ensuring Generational Balance
4.1 System Function: Mechanisms for Generational Continuity and Healthy Civilizational Transmission
No civilization is built by a single generation.
A truly healthy civilization requires:
•	A balanced, sustainable generational structure;
•	The rejection of bloodline worship and patriarchal dominance, ensuring individual value outweighs birth status;
•	The careful balance of reproductive autonomy, social responsibility, and population structural health.
This system determines whether a civilization can:
•	Safeguard individual freedom while maintaining structural stability and generational continuity;
•	Prevent “family” or “bloodline” from becoming tools for resource monopoly and power oppression;
•	Detect and correct generational structural risks before they undermine the system’s long-term viability.
4.2 Typical Mechanisms and Manifestations
Different civilizations have explored various reproductive and inheritance structures:
(1) Marriage Systems
•	Most global civilizations use marriage structures to regulate generational continuity and social stability;
•	Reality: In parts of East Asian societies, marriage is deeply entangled with family, resources, and social status—strengthening structural stability while constraining individual freedom.
(2) Education Systems
•	Transmitting knowledge and values across generations ensures civilizational continuity;
•	Reality: In some global population giants, education systems function both as pathways for social mobility and as tools for family resource monopolization and class solidification.
(3) Child Rights Protection
•	Legal and institutional safeguards for children’s independent development rights weaken absolute bloodline control;
•	Example: Some developed Western countries have enhanced child welfare and anti-domestic violence mechanisms, raising civilization’s human rights baseline.
(4) Women’s Empowerment and Reproductive Autonomy
•	Legal, economic, and cultural reforms dismantle gender oppression and patriarchal control within reproductive structures;
•	Reality: In some developed countries, women’s reproductive autonomy has increased, but low birth rates and population structural imbalances have emerged.
(5) Population Planning Policies
•	State-controlled population mechanisms aim to balance resource pressures and population structure;
•	Reality: In global population giants, long-term population planning policies have contributed to aging populations and severe generational structural disruptions.
4.3 Structural Risks
When reproductive and inheritance systems lack structural balance, civilizations face:
(1) Bloodline Worship and Patriarchal Tyranny
•	“Family” and “bloodline” become covers for systemic oppression and resource concentration;
•	Reality: In parts of East Asian societies, patriarchal structures deeply embedded in culture result in institutional suppression of women and younger generations.
(2) Generational Oppression and Structural Anxiety
•	Long-term structural imbalances trap younger generations in systemic difficulties related to education, employment, and social identity;
•	Example: In some global population giants, youth face widespread reproductive anxiety, class rigidity, and limited social mobility.
(3) Collapsing Birth Rates and Aging Crises
•	Structural reproductive pressure and social risks converge, driving birth rates downward;
•	Reality: In parts of East Asian economic powers and developed Western nations, persistently low birth rates and aging populations are accelerating structural vulnerability.
(4) Population Structural Imbalance and Civilizational Metabolic Dysfunction
•	Prolonged generational structural imbalance erodes civilization’s regenerative capacity;
•	Innovation stagnates, social burdens increase, and structural collapse risks intensify.
Summary
A healthy reproductive and structural inheritance system is not simply about population numbers.
It is a cornerstone for:
•	Civilizational structural balance;
•	Generational vitality;
•	Social stability;
•	Long-term evolutionary resilience.
Such a system must:
•	Guarantee individual freedom and reproductive autonomy;
•	Reject bloodline worship and patriarchal tyranny;
•	Balance population structure, resource pressures, and civilizational metabolic needs.
When the system breaks down, civilizations face:
•	Bloodline worship, patriarchal oppression, and systemic devaluation of individuals;
•	Youth anxiety, generational fragmentation, and innovation collapse;
•	Plummeting birth rates, aging populations, and demographic structural crises;
•	Ultimately, systemic metabolic failure and structural self-destruction.
5. Legal and Institutional Framework: Power Checks and Social Order
5.1 System Function: Social Regulation, Power Constraints, and Structural Stability
Civilization is not merely about groups surviving together.
A truly functional civilization requires:
•	A systematic legal and institutional framework;
•	Mechanisms to regulate social relations, restrain power, and maintain basic order;
•	Protection against tyranny, corruption, and structural chaos, ensuring a civilization’s ability to self-correct and evolve sustainably.
The legal and institutional framework functions like the skeletal and muscular systems of the human body:
•	Providing necessary structural support and order;
•	Maintaining a degree of flexibility and adaptability to environmental changes;
•	Without it, civilizations descend into power abuse, social disorder, and eventual structural collapse.
5.2 Typical Mechanisms and Manifestations
Human civilizations have produced various structural mechanisms within the legal and institutional domain:
(1) Constitutions and Rule-of-Law Systems
•	Constitutions establish the basic structure of power and protect citizens’ fundamental rights;
•	Reality: In some developed Western countries, constitutional and legal systems are relatively robust, providing a foundation for order and power balance.
(2) Democratic Systems and Separation of Powers
•	Democratic systems reduce authoritarianism and structural rigidity by regulating power sources and transitions;
•	Separation of legislative, judicial, and executive powers prevents power overconcentration;
•	Reality: Although flawed in implementation, some democratic societies retain strong institutional resilience.
(3) International Law and Global Coordination Mechanisms
•	Legal frameworks beyond national borders regulate international behavior and reduce conflict risks;
•	Examples: The United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and various international conventions provide a foundational framework for global civilizational order.
(4) Centralized Power and High-Efficiency Mobilization Structures
•	In certain major East Asian countries and resource-exporting states, highly centralized power structures enhance policy execution and national mobilization;
•	These structures also conceal significant risks of power abuse and social suffocation.
5.3 Structural Risks
When legal and institutional frameworks lack structural balance, civilizations face:
(1) Power Abuse and Hollow Democracy
•	Overconcentrated power with inadequate oversight breeds corruption and authoritarian tendencies;
•	Reality: In a major East Asian country, the appearance of rule of law masks underlying administrative dominance over legal structures, causing severe institutional imbalance.
(2) Dysfunctional Separation of Powers and Institutional Hollowing
•	Institutions may exist formally, while actual power operations are distorted;
•	Example: In parts of Latin America, democratic institutions appear intact, but power and capital collude to control society, leading to persistent instability.
(3) Expansion of Centralization and Social Suffocation
•	Centralization can improve short-term efficiency but long-term suppresses social vitality and innovation;
•	Reality: In some resource-exporting nations and East Asian economic powers, economic growth coexists with declining social participation and institutional flexibility.
(4) Legal Formalism and Institutional Corrosion
•	Laws exist on paper but are poorly enforced, creating a dangerous gap between formal institutions and actual power;
•	This fosters deep social distrust and undermines structural stability.
Summary
The legal and institutional framework determines whether a civilization can:
•	Sustain systemic checks on power;
•	Effectively regulate social order and prevent structural chaos;
•	Dynamically balance power, society, and structure while maintaining self-correction capabilities.
A healthy legal and institutional structure:
•	Ensures basic fairness and social stability;
•	Prevents power abuse and systemic corruption;
•	Facilitates institutional renewal and enhances civilizational resilience.
When the system falters, civilizations face:
•	Power rigidity and social vitality collapse;
•	Legal hollowness and institutional decay;
•	Runaway centralization and structural breakdown;
•	Ultimately, the loss of self-regulation and the capacity for healthy, sustainable evolution—leading to structural self-destruction.
6. Human Values and Civilizational Direction: Avoiding Confusion and Extremes
6.1 System Function: Civilizational Goals, Value Constraints, and Directional Guidance
Civilization is not defined solely by material prosperity or technological advancement.
A truly resilient civilization must possess:
•	A clear, coherent system of human values;
•	A shared vision for development and social consensus;
•	The ability to avoid collective value confusion and extreme tendencies during prosperity, crises, or structural transformations.
The human values and direction system determines whether a civilization can:
•	Find structural balance among human dignity, freedom, love, and social responsibility;
•	Prevent society from drifting toward instrumentalism and systemic self-destruction under the pressure of utilitarianism, technology, or distorted nationalism.
Without a healthy value system, even the most advanced technologies, economies, and institutions will ultimately produce structural hollowing and spiritual collapse.
6.2 Typical Mechanisms and Manifestations
Throughout history, civilizations have explored various mechanisms for value formation and directional guidance:
(1) Religious and Ethical Systems
•	Religions and ethical frameworks shape social values and behavioral boundaries;
•	Reality: In some regions, religion provides social order and spiritual support, but it can also foster dogmatism and extremism.
(2) Enlightenment Thought and Modern Human Rights Concepts
•	Emphasizing reason, freedom, equality, and individual dignity, these movements have reshaped modern civilization’s trajectory;
•	Typical Example: Parts of North America and Western Europe have established human rights protections and social progress paths based on Enlightenment values.
(3) Liberalism and Environmental Protection Ideals
•	Through institutions and social consensus, these frameworks promote individual freedom, environmental responsibility, and sustainable development;
•	Reality: Some developed countries have made significant progress in these areas but also face emerging structural extremism.
6.3 Structural Risks
When the human values and direction system becomes unbalanced, civilizations face:
(1) Extremism and Value Distortion
•	Religious, nationalist, political, or technological extremism hijacks the language of values to justify structural control;
•	Reality: Some regions experience religious extremism, technological worship, and distorted nationalism reshaping society and suppressing diversity and freedom.
(2) Nihilism and Spiritual Collapse
•	Driven by utilitarianism and consumerism, individuals and societies lose sight of meaningful goals;
•	Typical Example: In parts of East Asian economic powers and North America, beneath surface-level prosperity lies widespread spiritual emptiness, generational anxiety, and value disorientation.
(3) Consumerism and Instrumentalism Expansion
•	Freedom is reduced to mere consumer choice, and consumption becomes the sole marker of identity;
•	Technology, capital, and power collude to hijack social direction, pushing civilization toward instrumental logic and value hollowing.
(4) Technological Supremacy and Nationalism Distortion
•	Technology is deified as civilization’s ultimate pursuit, neglecting human nature and social structural balance;
•	Nationalism, under the guise of culture and security, fosters structural isolation and external rejection, pushing civilizations toward extremism.
Summary
The human values and direction system determines whether a civilization can:
•	Maintain a healthy balance among humanity, freedom, dignity, and structural integrity;
•	Resist extreme tendencies and value distortion during crises and transitions;
•	Sustain civilizational self-correction and developmental resilience.
A healthy system of values and direction:
•	Prevents society from becoming lost in prosperity illusions or technological instrumentalism;
•	Protects against structural extremism and spiritual hollowing;
•	Promotes love, freedom, dignity, reason, and structurally healthy development.
When this system breaks down, civilizations fall into:
•	Extremism, nihilism, and structural distortion;
•	Social fragmentation, value collapse, and directional confusion;
•	Ultimately, they lose their spiritual foundation and capacity for healthy evolution, accelerating systemic self-destruction.
7. The Immunity System: Structural Risk Identification and Defense
7.1 System Function: Civilizational Self-Defense and Structural Health Safeguard
No civilization is permanently immune to risk.
A truly healthy civilization must possess:
•	Systematic mechanisms for risk identification;
•	The ability to resist structural infiltration and internal corrosion;
•	Early warning and effective response capabilities against pseudo-civilizations, authoritarian expansion, and systemic imbalance.
The immunity system functions like the immune system of a living organism:
•	Detecting external threats and internal dysfunction;
•	Preventing structural diffusion of crises and systemic collapse;
•	Ensuring that civilization maintains the ability to self-repair and evolve healthily in the face of crises, conflicts, and infiltration.
Without an effective immunity system, civilizations may appear prosperous but are inherently fragile.
Once faced with structural infiltration or internal decay, the entire system risks collapse.
7.2 Typical Mechanisms and Manifestations
Human civilization has developed various mechanisms to strengthen its immunity system:
(1) Democratic Mechanisms and Institutional Power Constraints
•	Public elections, media oversight, and power alternation mechanisms help resist systemic corruption and authoritarian tendencies;
•	Reality: Parts of North America and Western Europe, while flawed, maintain relatively resilient institutional immunity.
(2) Investigative Journalism and Information Transparency
•	Independent media, investigative mechanisms, and transparent information disclosure expose abuses of power and structural risks;
•	Examples: Some media outlets in North America and Western Europe have played crucial roles in revealing abuses by global tech giants and government overreach.
(3) International Conventions and Cross-Border Regulatory Mechanisms
•	International law and multilateral organizations coordinate defense against shared structural risks;
•	Examples: Global cooperation on data protection, civil rights, and resisting authoritarian infiltration is gradually taking shape.
(4) Academic Critique and Structural Risk Exposure
•	Scholars and thinkers systematically study and expose hidden structural vulnerabilities and systemic traps;
•	Reality: Certain academic institutions and think tanks actively reveal imbalances in technology, politics, and culture.
(5) Boundary of Civilization Theory (Your Framework)
•	A comprehensive structural perspective for identifying pseudo-civilizations, systemic infiltration, and cultural camouflage;
•	Lays the foundation for building a systematic civilizational immunity framework that safeguards healthy evolution.
7.3 Structural Risks
When immunity systems are weakened or systematically compromised, civilizations face:
(1) Immunity Collapse and Civilizational Apathy
•	Power and capital conspire to weaken social immune mechanisms, breeding systemic corruption and dysfunction;
•	Reality: In some resource-dependent states and major East Asian countries, immunity systems exist only on paper, while society becomes numb to authoritarianism, corruption, and structural imbalance.
(2) Spread of Pseudo-Freedom and False Pluralism
•	Superficial information openness and institutional pluralism mask deepening structural monopolies and control;
•	Examples: Some global information platform companies operate under the guise of freedom while manipulating information, suppressing dissent, and reshaping social structures.
(3) Reverse Infiltration by Authoritarian Systems
•	Certain authoritarian states and cultures leverage technology, capital, and cultural exports to systematically erode open societies;
•	Reality: Some Western societies, through economic dependence, technological collaboration, and cultural integration, are gradually losing their structural immunity.
(4) Civilizational Self-Anesthesia and Risk Blindness
•	Obsessed with prosperity illusions and technological fanaticism, civilizations lose vigilance toward internal risks and external infiltration, exacerbating systemic fragility.
Summary
The immunity system is a civilization’s:
•	Final line of defense against external infiltration and internal decay;
•	Core mechanism for maintaining structural health, power balance, and social stability;
•	Systematic safeguard for self-repair, risk identification, and structural security.
A healthy civilizational immunity system:
•	Possesses efficient risk detection and information transparency mechanisms;
•	Maintains systematic power oversight and structural defense capabilities;
•	Effectively resists pseudo-civilizations, structural infiltration, and cultural camouflage;
•	Ensures civilization evolves healthily amid openness, integration, and crisis.
When the system fails, civilizations face:
•	Immunity collapse, structural corrosion, and social risk accumulation;
•	Authoritarian infiltration, information monopolies, and structural control;
•	The proliferation of pseudo-freedom and civilizational self-anesthesia;
•	Ultimately, the loss of self-protection and healthy evolutionary capacity, accelerating systemic self-destruction.
Conclusion: The Seven Fundamental Systems That Determine Civilizational Survival
Without a systematic structural foundation, no civilization can grow healthily.
Without clear functional division and coordinated mechanisms, civilization inevitably falls into chaos, self-harm, and eventual collapse.
The seven fundamental systems presented in this chapter form the structural core of how civilizations survive, evolve, and maintain systemic health:
Structural Logic: Interdependence Determines Civilizational Health
These seven systems operate both independently and in close coordination.
The collapse or dysfunction of any one system triggers cascading failures across the entire civilization:
•	Disrupted information systems → intellectual confusion → collapse of structural cognition;
•	Resource system imbalance → social polarization → economic crises;
•	Integration system failures → cultural erosion → loss of civilizational identity;
•	Reproductive system crises → generational despair → demographic collapse;
•	Institutional decay → unchecked power → social disorder and collapse;
•	Value system distortion → spiritual breakdown → loss of direction;
•	Immunity failure → infiltration and structural control → systemic collapse.
Final Warning
Technological progress, economic growth, and surface-level prosperity
mean nothing without coherent structural design and coordinated system functionality.
Civilization is not a patchwork of isolated elements or temporary prosperity.
At its core, civilization is the stable, coordinated operation of a complex structural system.
If humanity continues to neglect structural design and systemic health, there are only two possible outcomes:
•	Either: Civilization disintegrates and self-destructs under the illusion of short-term prosperity;
•	Or: We confront structural realities, rebuild the system, and guide civilization toward healthy, sustainable evolution.
In the next part,
this book will systematically classify humanity’s major civilizational achievements and foundational ideas,
organizing them within the seven-system framework,
providing the first truly systematic, structurally coherent map of human civilization’s health and risks.
Chapter 3: Structural Deficiency and the Silent Collapse of Civilizations
1. From the Soviet Union to a Major East Asian Country: The Tragedy of Structural Disorder
The collapse of civilizations is rarely triggered solely by external forces.
More often, it originates from within—through the gradual disorder, distortion, and disintegration of internal structures.
Looking back on the 20th century, humanity has witnessed multiple tragic examples of structural failure.
Among them, the downfall of the Soviet system and the structural crisis within a major East Asian country stand as classic, cautionary tales of systemic imbalance and dysfunction.
1.1 The Structural Illusion of the Former Soviet System
On the surface, the Soviet system appeared to possess:
•	A centrally planned economy and unified national management, seemingly indicating rigid structural control;
•	Strong authoritarian politics, mass mobilization, and ideological conformity, projecting an illusion of “iron discipline”;
•	Periodic technological, military, and industrial breakthroughs, fueling the illusion of a thriving great power.
Yet beneath this façade:
•	Severe information suppression crippled social cognition and eliminated feedback mechanisms;
•	Extreme resource misallocation driven by forced state control created inefficiency and systemic corruption;
•	Absolute power monopoly eradicated checks and balances, stifling social vitality and innovation.
This distorted structural arrangement temporarily maintained surface-level order,
but over time, internal rigidity intensified and social metabolism collapsed entirely.
Ultimately, the illusion of strength crumbled under structural pressure,
the entire civilizational system lost its basic viability,
and the disintegration of the Soviet Union became history’s most extreme example of systemic collapse caused by structural failure.
1.2 The Structural Distortion of a Major East Asian Country
In the 21st century, the rapid economic and technological rise of a major East Asian country
was once heralded as a model of “structural reform” and “civilizational progress.”
Yet beneath the surface, deep structural contradictions persist—and in many ways, have worsened:
•	Market-oriented economic reforms coexist with highly centralized political control, creating systemic tension;
•	Extreme information control and institutionalized censorship severely restrict cognitive space;
•	Family and social structures reinforce cultural closedness, with bloodline ideologies curbing individual freedoms;
•	Superficial structural stability masks deep internal fragility, with no genuinely healthy social metabolism.
This systemic clash between power, economy, and society may be concealed in the short term
through administrative efficiency and resource mobilization,
but over the long term, structural distortion is steadily eroding the foundations of civilization:
•	Economic overdependence on global markets coexists with internal resource misallocation;
•	Social innovation capacity is systematically suppressed by the power structure;
•	Family, generational, and educational systems are dysfunctional, pushing civilizational metabolism toward collapse.
The “stable prosperity” projected by this major East Asian country
rests precariously on the edge of structural imbalance.
1.3 Common Features of Structural Disorder
From the Soviet system to the contemporary East Asian power,
their patterns of structural disorder share striking similarities:
(1) Fragmentation Between Economy, Power, and Thought
•	The economy appears to develop independently but is fundamentally controlled by political structures;
•	The thought system is sealed and manipulated, suppressing feedback and innovation;
•	The misalignment of these three systems tears apart internal coherence and destroys systemic synergy.
(2) Generational Imbalance and the Collapse of Social Vitality
•	Structural imbalance intensifies generational conflict and entrenches social stratification;
•	Younger generations lack structural participation opportunities, innovation capacity breaks down;
•	The civilization’s metabolic functions deteriorate, leading to systemic social exhaustion.
(3) Hollow Strength and Imminent Civilizational Collapse
•	In the short term, economic and political structures maintain the illusion of strength;
•	In reality, structural foundations are fragile, feedback mechanisms are absent, civilizational resilience is minimal;
•	When external shocks or internal crises escalate, the entire civilizational system faces imminent, systemic collapse.
2. The Soft Collapse of the Free World: Immunity Degradation and Directional Confusion
When discussing the collapse of civilizations, people often associate it with authoritarianism, violence, or external oppression.
Yet in reality, many civilizations decay not from external shocks,
but from a slow, internal process of structural degradation.
The “soft collapse” phenomenon emerging within parts of the free world
is silently eroding the foundations of democracy, rule of law, and the institutional resilience that once defined these societies.
2.1 Intellectual Fragmentation and Institutional Hollowing
In parts of North America and Western Europe, pluralism and freedom have long been accepted as societal norms.
However, without structural design and systemic coordination, this pluralism is accelerating into:
•	Cognitive chaos and ideological fragmentation, undermining social consensus;
•	The failure of structural feedback mechanisms, resulting in complex but hollow institutions;
•	Democracy, freedom, and rights becoming increasingly superficial and empty.
Typical manifestations include:
•	Competing intellectual factions and theoretical silos, fragmenting public discourse;
•	Polarized media ecosystems, with echo chambers and algorithmic manipulation coexisting;
•	Institutional operations becoming highly formalized, while policy coordination and governance efficiency steadily decline.
Beneath the appearance of “diverse freedom”
lurks a deep, structural disorder and systemic dysfunction.
2.2 Structural Imbalance Between Democracy and the Market
Democracy and markets were intended to complement and balance one another within the free world.
But under unchecked capital influence and structural design failures,
the two are diverging toward dangerous imbalance:
(1) Hollowed Democracy and Capital-Captured Power
•	Capital controls public opinion, political donations, and policy agendas;
•	The sources of power and social feedback mechanisms are profoundly distorted;
•	Formal democracy remains, but citizens’ actual political participation is systematically eroded.
(2) Market Distortion and Deepening Inequality
•	Market mechanisms have deviated from the goal of fairness, with capital monopolies entrenching social stratification;
•	Technological and financial power is highly concentrated, fueling systemic wealth disparity;
•	Resource allocation increasingly serves private interests over the public good.
The structural rupture between democracy and markets
is steadily undermining the free world’s capacity for institutional self-correction.
2.3 Value Confusion and Extremism Trends
Under the dual pressures of structural disorder and systemic imbalance,
the value system of the free world is undergoing systemic disintegration:
(1) The Rise of Consumerism and Nihilism
•	Freedom is reduced to consumer choice, and happiness is distorted into material accumulation;
•	Values are hollowed out, and society suffers from severe spiritual deficiency.
(2) Identity Politics and Social Fragmentation
•	Excessive labeling based on race, gender, culture, or ideology;
•	Group identity supersedes public values, accelerating systemic social polarization.
(3) The Marginalization of Love, Freedom, and Dignity
•	Traditional values are often branded as “politically incorrect,” and public discourse becomes severely distorted;
•	Rational consensus and human compassion gradually disappear from the public sphere.
As the free world’s value system loses its foundation,
the entire civilization slides toward structural extremism and spiritual hollowness.
2.4 Immunity System Degradation Risks
A civilization’s immunity system is its final defense against structural risks and external infiltration.
Yet under structural imbalance and value collapse,
the free world’s immunity system is visibly weakening:
(1) Information Manipulation and Pseudo-Freedom
•	Global information platforms monopolize discourse, transforming freedom of speech into algorithmic control;
•	Superficial diversity masks deepening cognitive uniformity and extremism.
(2) False Pluralism and Structural Camouflage
•	The illusion of “diversity” and “inclusion” conceals underlying structural control and cultural infiltration;
•	Authoritarian cultures and pseudo-civilizational ideologies subtly penetrate the free world through economic, technological, and cultural channels.
The free world’s “immunity degradation”
is not a dramatic collapse,
but a slow-boiling, systemic self-numbing and structural decay process.
3. Structural Deficiency and the Logic of Civilizational Collapse
Beneath the surface of economic miracles, technological breakthroughs, and material prosperity,
many civilizations quietly accumulate systemic deficiencies and hidden structural crises.
Once structural imbalances surpass critical thresholds,
civilizations inevitably enter a stage of comprehensive, irreversible collapse.
This process is not isolated or sudden.
It unfolds through systemic chain reactions driven by structural deficiencies,
ultimately disabling the civilization’s core functions and triggering self-destruction.
3.1 The Chain Reaction of Structural Deficiency
Structural deficiency never manifests as a singular event.
It emerges through the interaction and cascading failure of multiple interconnected systems:
(1) Information System Disorder → Cognitive Breakdown
•	The collapse of information circulation mechanisms fragments public understanding;
•	Social consensus disintegrates, rational decision-making becomes impossible.
(2) Resource System Misallocation → Economic Imbalance
•	Resource circulation is disrupted, undermining productivity and social equity;
•	Wealth gaps widen, monopolies intensify, ecological crises escalate.
(3) Institutional System Dysfunction → Power Abuse
•	Power structures distort, institutional checks and feedback collapse;
•	Governance becomes hollow, corruption spreads, social stability erodes.
(4) Value System Disintegration → Extremism and Direction Loss
•	Shared values collapse, replaced by consumerism, nationalism, and nihilism;
•	Societal direction vanishes, spiritual hollowing accelerates.
(5) Immunity System Failure → Pseudo-Civilization Infiltration
•	Risk detection and structural defense mechanisms break down;
•	Authoritarian ideologies, cultural camouflage, and systemic infiltration spread unchecked.
Ultimately, from information disorder to structural collapse,
civilizations follow a self-destructive, systemic chain reaction.
3.2 The Illusion of Civilizational Prosperity
Throughout history and today, many civilizations exhibit “golden moments” of prosperity
just before their structural collapse:
•	Impressive economic growth and booming financial markets;
•	Continuous technological breakthroughs and expanding global influence;
•	Rapid urban development and soaring consumption, creating an illusion of stability.
Typical Examples:
•	Late-Stage Soviet System: Technological and military advancements, growing international presence,
while internal rigidity and social vitality collapsed, leading to systemic disintegration.
•	Contemporary East Asian Powers: Economic miracles and technological ambition fuel global admiration,
yet internal structural fragmentation, social metabolic disorders,
and systemic self-destruction risks are hidden beneath the surface.
Prosperity illusions often serve as the final veil before structural collapse.
3.3 Historical Cases of Structural Civilizational Collapse
History provides countless examples where structural deficiency triggered total civilizational failure:
(1) The Late Roman Empire
•	Rigid power structures, resource extraction, and deep social divisions;
•	Despite military strength and cultural prestige, the empire disintegrated as internal structures collapsed.
(2) The Mayan Civilization
•	Ecological imbalance and societal structural breakdown;
•	The civilization vanished entirely despite its cultural achievements.
(3) The Age of Imperialism
•	Short-term prosperity driven by global resource exploitation masked deep structural crises;
•	World Wars I and II exposed and accelerated systemic collapse.
Structural deficiency has always been the underlying cause of irreversible civilizational failure.
3.4 The Contemporary Risks of Global Structural Collapse
Today, structural crises are accumulating simultaneously across global civilization:
(1) Authoritarian Expansion
•	Technology and centralized power converge, fueling the resurgence of authoritarian structures;
•	Democratic and freedom-based systems face systemic structural erosion.
(2) Freedom Regression
•	Internal structural imbalances within the free world erode institutions and values;
•	Superficial freedom masks deepening structural control.
(3) Technological Distortion
•	Technology develops in isolation from humanistic values;
•	Data manipulation, algorithmic extremism, and power-driven technological tools proliferate.
(4) Ecological Imbalance
•	The global resource system is destabilized, with ecological metabolic functions nearing collapse.
(5) Generational Breakdown
•	Reproductive systems and intergenerational transmission mechanisms collapse;
•	Demographic crises intensify globally.
If these structural crises exceed systemic tolerance thresholds,
global civilization faces comprehensive, irreversible collapse.
Conclusion: Structural Deficiency Inevitably Leads to Civilizational Collapse
Structure determines the fate of civilizations.
Whether it was the dramatic collapse of the former Soviet system,
or the structural crises hidden within major East Asian powers and parts of the free world today,
the root cause is always the same:
the absence of healthy structural design and systemic coordination.
Civilizations are not sustained by surface-level prosperity, short-term technological breakthroughs, or inflated economic statistics.
What truly determines their survival is the deep, systemic health and stability of their structural foundations.
Key Warnings from This Chapter:
(1) Structural Disorder Is the Precursor to Civilizational Self-Destruction
•	Economic, political, and intellectual systems become fragmented, undermining social cohesion;
•	Generational structures break down, draining social vitality and innovation;
•	Beneath the illusion of strength, civilizations face the constant risk of systemic collapse.
(2) Soft Collapse Is Equally Destructive
•	Within parts of the free world, structural imbalances, immunity degradation, and value confusion intensify;
•	Seemingly “moderate” structural decay quietly erodes civilizational foundations;
•	Without structural defenses, even democratic societies cannot withstand systemic breakdown.
(3) Structural Chain Reactions Cannot Be Ignored
•	Information disorder → Resource misallocation → Institutional dysfunction → Value collapse → Risk exposure;
•	Once this sequence begins, civilizations enter an irreversible process of systemic structural collapse.
(4) History and Reality Show Structural Collapse Is Relentless
•	The Roman Empire, the Mayan civilization, and the imperialist systems of the modern era all illustrate structural failure;
•	Contemporary global civilization faces structural crises in authoritarian expansion, technological distortion, ecological imbalance, and generational breakdown.
Final Judgment:
As long as structural deficiencies persist,
regardless of how prosperous, technologically advanced, or outwardly glorious a civilization may appear,
its ultimate trajectory leads in only one direction—systemic, self-inflicted destruction.
The next part of this book—the Comprehensive Civilizational Health Examination—
adopts a structural perspective to systematically identify, expose, and address these hidden, deep-rooted structural crises.
It provides humanity with the first truly scientific, systematic diagnostic tools
and structural reconstruction strategies to guide civilization back toward healthy, sustainable evolution.
Chapter 4: Systematic Positioning of Civilizational Achievements
1. Why Civilizational Achievements Must Be Systematically Positioned
On the surface, humanity’s civilizational achievements appear vast and brilliant—
countless ideas, theories, institutions, technologies, and cultural artifacts have emerged.
Yet beneath this apparent richness lies a deep, long-standing problem of fragmentation.
Ideas exist in isolation, institutions operate in silos, and classic works lack structural integration.
As a result, instead of promoting coordinated civilizational evolution,
fragmentation has fueled theoretical confusion, social division, and civilizational disorientation.
Without a systematic, structural positioning of human civilization’s achievements,
we are destined to spiral into structural disorder and self-destruction—
trapped within the illusion of diversity, yet structurally adrift.
1.1 The Era of Fragmented Understanding
For much of history, mainstream human understanding of civilization has been deeply fragmented:
(1) Ideological Fragmentation
•	Competing schools of thought and theories develop in isolation, lacking structural coordinates;
•	Liberalism, conservatism, nationalism, technological utopianism, and others clash without systemic integration,
leading to profound cognitive polarization.
(2) Institutional Isolation
•	Democracy, centralization, market economies, planned economies, religion—all operate as isolated systems;
•	Without structural alignment, institutional patchworks emerge, breeding systemic dysfunction.
(3) Classic Works Floating in a Vacuum
•	Influential works such as The Bible, The Quran, The Analects, The Social Contract, On Liberty, The Communist Manifesto, On the Origin of Species, 1984, and others
are discussed in isolation, detached from any holistic structural framework;
•	Their contributions and risks coexist, yet lack systematic positioning and structural evaluation.
The Consequences of Fragmentation:
•	Theoretical confusion, social disorientation, civilizational self-harm.
Despite humanity’s wealth of civilizational achievements,
the absence of systematic positioning has only deepened structural chaos.
1.2 The Significance of Systematic Positioning
To break free from the trap of fragmented understanding,
humanity must systematically position all civilizational achievements
within the framework of the seven fundamental structural systems.
(1) Returning to Structure: Clarifying Contributions and Risks
•	Every idea, theory, institution, cultural practice, and technology
must be positioned within one of the seven structural systems:
Information, Resources, Integration, Reproduction, Institutions, Values, Immunity;
•	Only then can we clearly distinguish their positive contributions from their potential structural risks.
(2) Exposing Blind Spots: Preventing Civilizational Misjudgments
•	Through systematic positioning, structural imbalances and hidden blind spots are revealed;
•	Only with structural clarity can we avoid mistaking isolated achievements for “universal solutions,”
thereby preventing ideological dogmatism, institutional worship, and pseudo-civilizational expansion.
(3) Building the Foundation for Healthy Civilizational Evolution
•	Positioning civilizational achievements is the essential prerequisite for structural health assessments and system reconstruction;
•	Without systematic positioning, civilization remains trapped in confusion, misjudgment, and self-destruction;
•	Only through structural alignment can civilization progress along a clear, coordinated, and sustainable evolutionary path.
2. Systematic Classification of Major Human Civilization Achievements According to the Seven Structural Systems
Civilization is not a random pile of concepts or ideologies. It is a structural system built from concrete human achievements—ideas, institutions, technologies, cultures, and classical works.
Without systematically integrating these achievements into the seven core structural systems of civilization, they easily become isolated fragments or even tools of manipulation, eventually turning against civilization itself.
This section systematically classifies the key achievements of human civilization based on the seven structural systems,
providing concrete historical examples, and listing three of the most representative books for each system to analyze their contributions and structural risks.

3. Comprehensive Summary of the Systematic Classification of Civilization Achievements
Through the systematic classification outlined above, it becomes clear:
All significant human achievements—ideas, institutions, technologies, cultures, and classics—
can and must be structurally positioned within the Seven Core Systems of Civilization.
This is not merely an academic exercise; it is a structural engineering project
that directly determines the health and future of human civilization.
Without systematic classification, civilization achievements often result in:
✅ Superficial prosperity masking internal chaos;
✅ Fragmented disciplines, disconnected structures;
✅ Blind reverence coupled with ignorance of risks;
✅ Civilization misjudging itself, leading to self-destructive development.
Once classification is completed, civilization gains:
3.1 A Visualized Map of Civilization Achievements
•	All major achievements are clearly categorized under the Seven Structural Systems;
•	Like dissecting a human body, the functions and positions of each part of civilization are made visible;
•	This framework not only aids academic research but also offers the general public an intuitive way to understand civilization.
Example:
In the past, discussions of The Bible, Das Kapital, and The Declaration of the Rights of Man were often isolated, even contradictory.
After systematic classification, we clearly see:
•	The Bible belongs to the Information-Nervous System, shaping cultural cognition and spiritual identity;
•	Das Kapital reveals structural risks within the Resource Circulation System;
•	The Declaration of the Rights of Man establishes the foundational values within the Human Values and Direction System.
Only when placed within their structural coordinates can these great works be properly understood, prevented from being misused, and prevented from neutralizing each other.
3.2 System Synergy and Structural Risk Exposure
Classification does not merely display achievements—it exposes:
•	Which systems are severely imbalanced in their development;
•	Which fields produce significant achievements that remain hidden or misused;
•	Which ideas and institutions inherently carry structural risks.
Observed Realities:
•	Rapid technological progress within the Resource Circulation System hides deepening wealth inequality and ecological crises;
•	Explosive development of the Information-Nervous System fuels information manipulation and cognitive fragmentation;
•	The Human Values and Direction System is increasingly marginalized, leading to widespread spiritual emptiness;
•	Degradation of the Immune System enables authoritarian ideology and pseudo-civilizations to infiltrate unnoticed.
The absence of system synergy is the fundamental reason behind the illusion of prosperity and the underlying fragility of contemporary civilization.
3.3 Systematic Classification is the Prerequisite for Civilization Health Diagnostics
Just as doctors must first understand the structure and function of the human body before conducting a health check,
civilization cannot be effectively examined without systematic classification.
Practical Significance of Classification:
✅ It eliminates blind reverence for achievements by enabling a structural understanding of their functions and limitations;
✅ It provides a clear structural map for civilization health diagnostics and risk assessment;
✅ It lays a solid foundation for future structural optimization and the design of a healthy civilization blueprint.
Summary:
Systematic classification of civilization is not an academic game—it is:
•	The first essential step toward confronting the complexity of civilization;
•	A necessary process to prevent fragmentation and self-destructive tendencies;
•	The only structural path that allows humanity to understand itself clearly and plan for a sustainable, healthy future.
In the next section, building on this classification, we will officially launch a systematic health examination of civilization.
4. Conclusion and Transition: A New Perspective After Systematic Classification
Through the systematic classification presented above, the basic structure of human civilization is now clear:
The Seven Core Systems form the essential life structure of human society.
All major ideas, institutions, technologies, cultures, and classical works
must—and can—be positioned within this structural map.
Only by doing so can civilization see itself clearly, avoid self-destruction, and pursue sustainable health.
However, classification is only the first step.
The more critical questions remain:
•	Are these systems actually healthy?
•	Does the structure revealed by classification show serious imbalances?
•	Which parts of civilization are declining, degenerating, or nearing collapse?
Systematic classification provides a visual map of civilization.
But only a thorough “health examination” truly exposes internal risks, identifies hidden diseases, and issues early warnings.
4.1 The Logical Progression from Classification to Examination
In any complex system, structural classification does not equate to health:
•	A society may appear structurally complete, yet be on the brink of collapse due to hidden imbalances;
•	Without examination, systemic risks and structural defects remain undetected;
•	Health diagnostics are the inevitable continuation of classification.
It is like:
•	A doctor first maps the human body, locating all organs;
•	But true health assessment requires systematic tests—analyzing indicators, detecting hidden dangers, identifying early-stage dysfunction.
Likewise, the health of civilization demands comprehensive, systematic, and structural examination.
4.2 Why Humanity Must Conduct a Health Examination of Civilization
History offers countless lessons: civilizations that failed to detect structural risks collapsed from within.
Case References:
•	The late Roman Empire: institutional stagnation, border breakdown, internal corruption—all ignored, leading to collapse;
•	The Mayan civilization: ecological and resource systems pushed to their limits, no systemic intervention, resulting in civilizational extinction;
•	Modern imperial powers: external expansion and resource plundering created short-term prosperity, but internal imbalances led to comprehensive collapse.
Contemporary humanity faces similar dangers:
•	Immune system degradation allows authoritarian ideology and pseudo-civilizations to infiltrate;
•	Severe resource system imbalances drive ecological crises;
•	The values and direction system has become hollow, fueling extremism and nihilism;
•	The information system appears vibrant but suffers from manipulation and cognitive fragmentation.
Without health diagnostics, humanity cannot identify, intervene, or repair these problems.
It will drift within the illusion of prosperity,
only to collapse from within—inevitably.
4.3 The Structural Arrangement of the Next Part of This Book
Classification is the map; the health examination is the action.
The next part of this book will introduce a systematic health diagnostic framework for civilization:
•	Detailed explanation of structural indicators for the Seven Core Systems;
•	Risk identification logic;
•	A comprehensive model integrating structural analysis with real-world data.
Following that, each of the Seven Systems will undergo a thorough health examination:
•	The information system, resource system, digestion and absorption system, reproductive system, legal-institutional system, human values and direction system, and immune system
•	Their current health status, structural risks, and potential collapse trends will be fully revealed.
Finally, based on the classification and diagnostic results,
a structural optimization proposal for civilization will be presented—
offering humanity a realistic path out of chaos, toward health, freedom, and long-term sustainability.
4.4 Conclusion: Structure Determines Civilization, Diagnosis Determines Destiny
Civilization is neither inherently strong nor eternal.
It is a fragile, complex system.
Structure determines health; chaos guarantees destruction.
Systematic classification is merely the beginning of self-awareness.
Health diagnostics and structural optimization determine the fate of civilization.
Next, we will officially enter the health examination phase of this book.
For the first time, humanity will systematically, structurally, and rationally
see its civilization for what it truly is—whether healthy, or silently sliding toward collapse.
Chapter 5: Repositioning and Dissecting Classical Ideas and Theories
1. Why Classical Ideas Must Be Repositioned
The greatness of human civilization has always been born from breakthroughs in ideas and theories.
Yet, the confusion, collapse, and self-destruction of civilization often hide within the misuse, distortion, and weaponization of those very “classics.”
Classical works are the light of civilization—
but they are also the hidden source of structural traps.
If these classics are not systematically repositioned within the Seven Structural Systems of Civilization,
it becomes impossible for humanity to distinguish:
•	which ideas drive healthy progress,
•	which masquerade as truth but lead to disaster,
•	and which have long been hijacked by power, capital, or ideology as tools of control.
1.1 The Dual Nature of Classical Ideas
History has proven time and again:
On the one hand, classical ideas are the foundation of civilizational progress:
•	Religious texts have constructed spiritual communities and shared values;
•	Political theories have driven institutional reform and the regulation of power;
•	Scientific thinking has expanded the boundaries of human cognition;
•	Literary works have exposed technological alienation and institutional darkness.
On the other hand, classics hide severe structural risks:
•	Blind worship leads to intellectual stagnation and social paralysis;
•	Extreme interpretations fuel violence and authoritarianism;
•	Manipulation by power structures turns them into tools of control;
•	Cherry-picked, decontextualized classics become banners for pseudo-civilizations to expand.
Without systematic repositioning and critical dissection, classics themselves can become dangerous “structural illusions” of civilization.
1.2 The Significance of Systematic Repositioning
The Seven Structural Systems of Civilization provide a clear coordinate framework for evaluating ideas and theories:
✅ Placing classics within their corresponding systems allows us to examine both their real contributions and their hidden risks;
✅ We can distinguish which ideas reinforce the structural health of civilization, and which conceal structural traps;
✅ We expose seemingly “sacred” theories that have been subtly weaponized as tools of control.
Put simply:
•	Classics are no longer suspended above civilization as untouchable “absolute truths”;
•	They return to their rightful place within the structural whole, subject to critical analysis, dissection, and optimization;
•	This is the only responsible, rational, and systematic path for governing civilization.
Otherwise, humanity will forever swing between “blind worship” and “total rejection,”
trapped in a cycle of self-inflicted destruction.
Section 2: Systematic Repositioning and Dissection of Classical Ideas and Theories
Ideas and theories are the blood and backbone of civilization.
But they are not sacred entities floating above structural reality.
They are tangible, dissectible, and must be systematically positioned within the Seven Structural Systems of Civilization.
This section systematically reviews humanity’s most influential classics,
places them within the structural framework,
and dissects their contributions and risks.
2.1 The Double-Edged Sword of Spiritual Systems
Representative Classics:
The Bible, The Quran, Buddhist Scriptures, The Analects of Confucius
Positioned Systems:
•	Information-Nervous System
•	Human Values and Direction System
Contributions:
✅ Shaped broad spiritual communities and shared value systems;
✅ Provided moral frameworks beyond secular power structures;
✅ Strengthened cultural cohesion and social stability in historical stages.
Structural Risks:
❗ Dogmatism and ideological monopoly stifle diversity and innovation;
❗ Religious extremism fuels violence and civilizational conflict;
❗ Cultural isolationism obstructs openness and structural optimization.
Real-World Cases:
•	The Crusades and Inquisitions legalized violence under the banner of faith;
•	Modern religious terrorism originates from extreme interpretations and structural misuse of sacred texts;
•	In certain regions, religion is used to suppress women and restrict thought, keeping civilization structurally stagnant.
2.2 Institutional Exploration and Structural Risks
Representative Classics:
On Liberty, The Social Contract, The Details of Democracy
Positioned Systems:
•	Legal and Institutional Framework System
•	Resource Circulation System
Contributions:
✅ Advanced democratic principles and power-balancing mechanisms;
✅ Strengthened civic rights and the rule of law;
✅ Provided theoretical foundations for optimizing institutional structures.
Structural Risks:
❗ Flawed theoretical design leads to hollow democracies and corporate capture;
❗ Blind institutional transplantation results in instability and disorder;
❗ Weak power balancing fosters pseudo-democracy and power distortion.
Real-World Cases:
•	In a North American nation, capital has hijacked democracy, distorting power structures and deepening social division;
•	In parts of Latin America, formal democracies coexist with state collapse and social violence;
•	In parts of Eastern Europe, surface-level democracy masks populism and oligarchic control, exposing deep structural risks.
2.3 Reflections on Resources and Evolution
Representative Classics:
Das Kapital, The Origin of Species
Positioned Systems:
•	Resource Circulation System
•	Digestion and Absorption System
Contributions:
✅ Exposed deep-rooted contradictions in resource distribution and social structures;
✅ Promoted systematic understanding of biological and civilizational evolution;
✅ Fueled social reform and scientific advancement.
Structural Risks:
❗ Ideological extremism fosters social division and violent conflict;
❗ Pseudoscientific misuse detaches technological progress from human values;
❗ Fragmented structural understanding disrupts societal balance.
Real-World Cases:
•	In an East Asian nation, extreme interpretations of Marxism led to centralized authoritarianism and social rupture;
•	Misapplication of Darwinism fueled social Darwinism and biological discrimination;
•	Unregulated technological development has alienated human structures through biotech and algorithmic governance.
2.4 Warnings, Reality, and the Future
Representative Classics:
1984, Animal Farm, Brave New World, Out of Control
Positioned Systems:
•	Immune System
•	Information-Nervous System
Contributions:
✅ Strongly warned against authoritarianism and information control;
✅ Exposed the risks of technological alienation and hollowed-out civilization;
✅ Fostered structural reflection on pseudo-civilizations.
Structural Risks:
❗ These works, when misused, foster nihilism and extreme societal pessimism;
❗ Excessive pessimism undermines confidence in civilizational reform;
❗ Technophobia leads to structural stagnation and fear-based governance.
Real-World Cases:
•	In parts of North America, conspiracy theories and excessive technological fear deepen cognitive fragmentation;
•	In an East Asian nation, a “soft 1984” reality quietly emerges, with sophisticated information control;
•	Globally, social media and algorithmic manipulation exacerbate technological alienation.
2.5 Other Important Ideas and Structural Evaluations
Representative Ideas:
•	Enlightenment thought and human rights declarations—positioned within the Human Values and Direction System
•	Nationalism—positioned within both the Values and Legal-Institutional Systems
•	Technological Supremacy—positioned within the Resource Circulation and Immune Systems
•	Consumerism—positioned within the Resource Circulation and Human Values Systems
Contribution and Risk Coexist:
✅ These ideas provide direction, momentum, and technological support for civilizational development;
❗ Yet they simultaneously drive value alienation, social extremism, and structural imbalances.
Section 3: Systemic Summary of Classic Deconstruction
Through structural repositioning and thorough analysis, one conclusion becomes clear:
Classic ideas are neither sacred truths nor inherent traps.
They are components of the broader civilizational structure—
carrying both contributions and risks,
depending entirely on whether humanity possesses the structural clarity to assess them critically.
3.1 Classics Are Not Faith — They Must Be Examined Structurally
History repeatedly proves:
•	Blind reverence for classics leads to ideological stagnation and structural rigidity;
•	Total rejection of classics invites social fragmentation and civilizational nihilism;
•	Only structural deconstruction and systemic placement can reveal the true essence of any classic.
Case reflections:
•	Religious texts left unexamined have fueled extremism and cultural conflict;
•	Democratic theory, unanchored structurally, has enabled pseudo-democracies and power distortions;
•	Capital and technology-driven doctrines, when mispositioned, have led directly to techno-authoritarianism and structural imbalance.
Classics are not divine.
They are structural tools—and must be audited as such.
3.2 Every Classic Contains Both Light and Shadow
No idea or theory is entirely correct or entirely safe.
The rule of structural realism:
✅ Every classic offers some contribution to the health and evolution of civilization;
❗ Every classic can also become a source of dysfunction if misused, distorted, or decontextualized.
In practice:
•	Religious, political, economic, technological, and literary classics
have all provided powerful engines for civilizational growth—
but they have also, in warped form, sparked wars, enabled dictatorships,
and cemented systems of oppression.
Duality is inherent.
Structure is the filter.
3.3 Classic Deconstruction Is Essential to Civilizational Diagnosis
Without deconstructing our classics, any attempt to “diagnose” civilization remains superficial:
•	Classics form the invisible architecture of society’s institutions and thought boundaries;
•	If left untouched, they conceal structural risks from plain view;
•	If left unpositioned, they become tools for authoritarian, ideological, or corporate manipulation.
In short:
✅ Classic deconstruction is a prerequisite for civilizational self-awareness;
✅ Structural repositioning is the foundation of a healthy and evolving future;
✅ Only by rejecting blind worship and absolute denial
can humanity hope to build a civilization that is structurally sound, morally clear, and intellectually resilient.
Chapter 6: The Methodology of Civilization Diagnostics
Section 1: Why We Need a Systematic Civilization Checkup
Throughout history, the collapse of civilizations has rarely come from sudden invasions or disasters. More often, it stems from long-term internal dysfunction—imbalances in their structural systems, hidden beneath illusions of progress and power.
A civilization checkup is not a luxury. It’s a necessity for survival.
1.1 The Illusion of Prosperity Masks Structural Crisis
In the modern world, the greatest danger to civilization is not “visible failure,” but the illusion that things are going well:
•	Technological advancement: AI, genetic engineering, and space exploration dominate headlines.
•	Economic growth: GDP rises, middle classes enjoy material abundance.
•	Institutional stability: Most states appear to have elections, constitutions, media, and education systems.
But beneath this glittering surface lies a growing rot:
•	Tech without ethics: Algorithms push extremism; deepfakes corrode public trust.
•	Growth without equity: Wealth is concentrated in a tiny elite; youth unemployment and aging populations explode.
•	Institutions without function: Constitutions exist, but rule of law fails; elections are held, but real power is unaccountable; media platforms multiply, but meaningful dialogue shrinks.
•	Values without meaning: Anxiety, nihilism, and mental health crises are rising as people lose a sense of collective direction and individual purpose.
These are not random phenomena. They are signs of systemic dysfunction—what we might call a hidden “cancer” of civilization.
Structural collapse often begins where a civilization is most confident.
1.2 Checkups Are the First Step Toward Civilizational Self-Rescue
To prevent collapse, hope is not a strategy. Analysis is.
Just as we check human bodies to prevent disease, we must conduct regular diagnostics on the systems of civilization:
•	Is the information system transparent and free?
•	Is resource distribution equitable and sustainable?
•	Are cultures integrating or being eroded?
•	Are younger generations supported, or sacrificed?
•	Is power truly checked by law, or merely ritualized?
•	Are core human values still alive, or replaced by market illusions?
•	Can the system detect and resist authoritarian infiltration or ideological rot?
Without this kind of full-spectrum checkup, civilization becomes like a high-speed train with broken brakes—gleaming on the outside, crumbling within.
Civilizations don’t fall from lack of tools, but from refusal to self-examine.
Conclusion
Systematic checkups are not acts of despair—they are acts of rational hope.
Through structural analysis and measurable diagnostics, we can:
•	Pierce through illusion;
•	Diagnose root causes;
•	Design paths to recovery.
What follows in this chapter is a comprehensive framework for civilization diagnostics:
•	Quantifiable indicators across seven core systems;
•	Methods to trace visible symptoms back to structural causes;
•	Models that combine real-world data with systemic logic.
This is not philosophy—it is survival engineering for the future of humanity.
Section 2: Structural Indicator System — The Quantitative Foundation of Civilizational Health
Civilization is not merely a collection of ideologies and institutions — it is a living structure.
To assess its health, we cannot rely on intuition or ideology. We must use measurable, structural indicators, just as medical doctors rely on heart rate, blood tests, and immune responses to diagnose a patient.
The seven foundational systems of civilization introduced in this book each demand their own diagnostic metrics. Only through a holistic and quantitative framework can we truly evaluate the vitality or decay of a society.
2.1 Core Indicators for the Seven Civilizational Systems
Below is a structural breakdown of core metrics aligned with each of the seven civilizational systems:
Information-Neural System
•	Freedom of Information: Independence of media, presence of censorship
•	Cognitive Diversity: Tolerance of dissent, ideological plurality
•	Transparency of Information: Availability and reliability of public and institutional data
Resource Circulation System
•	Fairness in Distribution: Income inequality metrics such as the Gini coefficient
•	Economic Structural Integrity: Diversification and resilience of the economic base
•	Ecological Health Index: Environmental sustainability and pollution levels
Digestive and Absorptive System
•	Cultural Integration Index: Ability to integrate external ideas without erasing internal identity
•	Efficiency of Civilizational Learning: Ability to adapt and adopt without blind imitation
•	Clarity of Cultural Boundaries: Maintenance of local values and identity amid globalization
Healthy Reproduction and Structural Transmission
•	Demographic Balance: Sustainable birth rates and age distribution
•	Intergenerational Fairness: Equitable access to opportunities and resources across generations
•	Gender Equity Index: Representation and equality across genders in education, labor, and governance
Legal and Institutional Framework
•	Checks and Balances Index: Independence and interdependence of branches of power
•	Effectiveness of Rule of Law: Whether laws are applied fairly and consistently
•	Institutional Transparency: Openness in policy-making and public administration
Human Values and Civilizational Direction
•	Value Consensus Index: Existence of shared ethical and moral principles
•	Extremism Risk Index: Prevalence of ideological polarization or hate movements
•	Mental Health Indicators: Depression, anxiety, and suicide trends at the societal level
Civilizational Immune System
•	Risk Detection Capacity: Responsiveness to structural and societal threats
•	Defense Against Pseudo-Civilizations: Resistance to manipulation, extremism, or authoritarian creep
•	Self-Repair Capacity: Ability to reform or correct failing institutions and social mechanisms
2.2 The Interconnected Nature of Indicators
These indicators are not standalone metrics. They are deeply interlinked and must be evaluated as a system:
•	When informational freedom declines, the immune system’s vigilance usually falters too.
•	When economic concentration rises, intergenerational and gender equity often suffer.
•	When cultural boundaries collapse, social cohesion and shared identity may erode.
Therefore, a structural diagnosis of civilization must not be a fragmented scorecard but an integrative map — tracking inter-system feedback loops and structural integrity.
Conclusion
The structural indicator system is the civilization’s equivalent of a blood test and neurological scan.
It transcends ideological bias.
It ignores surface-level headlines.
It instead reveals long-term, often invisible patterns of decay or resilience.
Only with such a framework can we understand not just whether a society is surviving — but whether it is truly thriving or quietly collapsing.
Chapter 6 – Methodology of Civilizational Diagnosis
Section 3: Risk Recognition Logic – From Superficial Symptoms to Structural Pathologies
The decline of a civilization rarely happens overnight.
It typically begins with scattered, often ignored “symptoms”—
small anomalies that signal deeper, hidden fractures within the system.
To conduct meaningful diagnostics, we must develop the logic to move
from surface-level symptoms to identifying structural disease.
3.1 Surface Symptoms: Civilization’s Distress Signals
Across the world, civilizations are exhibiting increasingly visible signs of internal strain:
•	Information Manipulation: Unified narratives, censorship of dissent, and hollow public discourse
•	Resource Imbalance: Expanding wealth gaps, entrenched class divisions, regional inequality
•	Social Anxiety: Plummeting birth rates, youth disengagement, rising loneliness and depression
•	Intergenerational Rupture: Total disconnection in values and priorities between generations
•	Power Corruption: A facade of legal order masking entrenched privilege and abuse
•	Value Disorientation: Rampant consumerism, spiritual emptiness, collective aimlessness
•	Immune System Decline: Diminishing capacity to detect authoritarian creep, pseudo-liberalism, or deceptive narratives
These symptoms, if ignored, do not fade—they metastasize into chronic decay.
3.2 Tracing the Underlying Pathologies: Structural Failures Beneath the Symptoms
Symptoms are surface signals. The real illness lies in the malfunctioning of civilizational structures.
Examples:
•	When information is tightly controlled, the information-neural system is paralyzed; no truth can circulate.
•	When young generations feel hopeless, the reproductive and transmission structure may be broken.
•	When law and governance feel hollow, it reveals a misalignment between legal frameworks and power systems.
A robust diagnostic model must do more than describe symptoms.
It must trace them back to their structural sources, penetrating beneath the political rhetoric and media noise.
3.3 Civilizational Fakery and Structural Traps: The Danger of “False Health”
Many contemporary societies appear “stable” or “advanced” on the surface, but are structurally fragile—
not due to lack of development, but due to civilizational mimicry and systemic deception:
•	Authoritarianism masked as democracy: Elections exist, but power is neither checked nor shared
•	Technology masked as progress: Innovation that serves surveillance and social control
•	Diversity masked as freedom: A facade of inclusion masking identity confusion and cultural erasure
•	Peace masked as order: Absence of violence, but also absence of dignity, expression, and creativity
This form of false vitality is more dangerous than open dysfunction—
harder to diagnose, harder to resist, and more corrosive over time.
Only structural diagnostics can uncover whether a society’s outer shine conceals
a hollowed-out, malfunctioning core—moving inexorably toward collapse.
Summary: From Symptoms to Systems—The Core Logic of Civilizational Diagnosis
•	Civilizational failure is rarely caused by isolated events; it stems from deep systemic breakdowns
•	Diagnostic thinking must connect surface-level crises to structural imbalances
•	We must develop clear frameworks to expose pseudo-structures and civilizational traps
•	Ultimately, a civilization’s ability to detect and repair itself depends on its courage to look inward
This structural logic forms the backbone of meaningful civilizational diagnostics.
Without it, we remain trapped in illusion—mistaking symptoms for causes, and decay for growth.
Chapter 6: The Methodology of Civilizational Diagnosis
Section 4: A Diagnostic Model Combining Data and Reality
The health of a civilization’s structure is not just a matter of philosophical speculation.
It can—and must—be assessed through a systematic, evolving diagnostic model grounded in both data and real-world observations.
Only by integrating quantitative indicators with qualitative insight can we develop a scientific, dynamic framework for evaluating civilizational health.
4.1 Quantitative Indicators: The Foundation for Structural Analysis
To diagnose a civilization, we must begin with metrics.
Each of the Seven Core Systems can be assessed through specific structural indicators, such as:
•	Information-Neural System → Freedom of information, media concentration, censorship prevalence
•	Resource Circulation System → Gini coefficient, resource efficiency, ecological sustainability index
•	Absorption & Integration System → Cultural integration rate, openness to foreign ideas, identity tension index
•	Reproductive & Generational Structure → Fertility rate, intergenerational equity index, gender parity ratio
•	Legal & Institutional Framework → Rule of law index, transparency of governance, institutional balance score
•	Human Values & Direction → Prevalence of extremism, value consensus score, mental health indicators
•	Immune System → Capacity to identify pseudocivilizations, academic independence, error-correction mechanisms
By applying these indicators, we can map the structural health of different nations, regions, and cultures.
Examples:
•	Northern European countries score high in value systems and institutional stability, but face rising cultural integration challenges due to immigration.
•	An East Asian power scores well in education and industrial organization but remains weak in information freedom and systemic immunity.
•	A North American democracy shows strong institutional openness but suffers from value polarization and declining immune capacity due to algorithmic manipulation.
This kind of comparative analysis reveals both systemic strengths and hidden vulnerabilities across civilizations.
4.2 Qualitative Observations: From Data to Structural Logic
While data is indispensable, it is not sufficient on its own.
Structural diagnosis requires contextual understanding and real-world analysis.
Examples:
•	A country may score well on press freedom, but if media is highly concentrated and public discourse tightly manipulated, the structural reality is fragile.
•	A nation might appear ecologically sustainable, but if its economy depends heavily on extractive industries, its long-term structure is at risk.
•	A society may seem liberal on the surface, yet suffer from plummeting fertility, high youth depression, and increasing isolation—clear signs of structural exhaustion.
A real diagnostic model connects these symptoms back to their systemic origins, avoiding surface-level misjudgments.
4.3 Dynamic Monitoring and Long-Term Tracking
Civilizations evolve.
Thus, any valid diagnostic model must allow for ongoing updates and temporal tracking:
•	Build a continuously updated civilizational health database
•	Monitor the long-term trends of structural indicators to detect emerging risks or signs of resilience
•	Offer reliable feedback loops to policymakers, reformers, and social innovators
This is not a one-time evaluation but a long-term structural monitoring process—
one that allows civilizations to escape the illusion of surface-level security and enter a cycle of proactive self-correction.
Summary: Data Informs, but Structure Determines
•	Data helps us identify structural symptoms, but structural logic interprets their meaning
•	Real-world cases provide depth, but systems thinking offers clarity
•	A truly effective civilizational diagnosis must combine quantitative analysis, structural insight, and historical tracking
This is the core purpose of our diagnostic model:
To build a structural mirror for humanity—
a mirror through which civilization can finally see itself clearly, and begin to heal.
Chapter 6: Methodology of Civilizational Diagnosis
Section 5: Conclusion — Diagnosis as the Prerequisite for Civilizational Health
Beneath the surface of technological advancement and institutional complexity,
civilizational structural crises are quietly accumulating.
Our repeated failure to address them stems largely from the absence of a systematic diagnostic framework.
Just as individual health depends on regular checkups,
a civilization’s health demands structural, system-wide evaluations.
Diagnosis is the foundation of self-awareness, a tool for risk detection, and the gateway to conscious evolution.
5.1 Without Diagnosis, Civilizations Survive by Luck Alone
History shows that most civilizational collapses were not triggered by external wars or sudden disasters,
but by unnoticed structural imbalances that built up over time:
•	Rome was technologically and institutionally advanced, yet rotting from within;
•	The Mayans excelled in astronomy and architecture, while their ecological and structural foundations crumbled;
•	The Soviet Union maintained military power while its information and resource systems were fatally paralyzed.
These civilizations appeared strong, but collapsed because they lacked self-awareness and structural diagnosis.
5.2 Structural Diagnosis Reveals the Civilization’s True Self
Through a structural examination of the seven core systems, we can:
•	Identify systemic risks, rather than just react to short-term crises;
•	Uncover the real state of institutions, culture, and thought, beyond superficial metrics;
•	Understand the structural differences and evolutionary trajectories between civilizations, enabling a more accurate global perspective.
Diagnosis allows civilizations to escape illusions and confront their reality.
5.3 What Comes Next: In-Depth Diagnosis of the Seven Systems
The next sections of this book will enter a system-by-system diagnosis:
From information networks to legal structures, from generational continuity to value systems,
we will examine each domain using structural frameworks, systemic indicators, and concrete case studies.
Because we know:
Without structural awareness, there can be no true civilizational self-rescue.
Civilizational diagnosis is not an act of condemnation —
it is an act of care.
It is how we come to see not only the fragility of what we’ve built,
but also the hope that still remains.
Chapter 7: System-by-System Health Check of Civilization
1. The Information-Nervous System: Control, Algorithms, and the Collapse of Truth
1.1 Health Standards
The information-nervous system serves as the cognitive core of any civilization. It enables intellectual freedom, shared understanding, and the capacity for innovation.
A healthy information system must ensure:
•	Free flow of information: Individuals can access and express ideas without repression.
•	Cognitive plurality: Diverse perspectives coexist without censorship or domination.
•	Transparency and verifiability: Public data is subject to scrutiny; power is visible and accountable.
•	Openness to innovation: Critical thinking is encouraged and protected.
Without these features, a civilization risks stagnation, manipulation, and authoritarian drift.
1.2 Diagnostic Reality
Phenomenon 1: Institutionalized Information Control
In a major East Asian country, large-scale censorship mechanisms — keyword bans, algorithmic filtering, and narrative management — create a controlled information environment. Search results, social media feeds, and traditional media are synchronized to promote official narratives.
Citizens live in fragmented realities, only permitted to access “authorized truths.”
In a major North American nation, platforms are formally open but informally shaped by corporate control, political polarization, and algorithmic echo chambers. Users are locked into ideological silos, rarely exposed to opposing views or critical perspectives.
Phenomenon 2: Algorithmic Enclosures of the Mind
Across regions, algorithm-driven platforms—from short video apps to search engines—have shifted user experience from active inquiry to passive consumption.
In a populous South Asian country, algorithmic feeds prioritize inflammatory nationalist content, contributing to real-world hate speech and violence.
Phenomenon 3: Decline of Media Trust and News Quality
Even in parts of Western Europe, press freedom faces subtle constraints due to corporate consolidation and political lobbying. In the race for attention, media increasingly resorts to sensationalism and clickbait, degrading public trust and reducing the space for deep analysis.
1.3 Structural Pathologies
•	Fragmented cognition: Populations exist in separate informational realities, undermining societal consensus.
•	Polarization and hate amplification: Emotion-driven algorithms reward extremism, eroding public reason.
•	Erosion of innovation: Homogenized information environments stifle original thinking and critical discourse.
•	Collapse of truth and trust: When people no longer agree on what is real, decision-making and cooperation break down at every level.
Conclusion:
The information-nervous system often collapses first—and most invisibly.
It does not destroy with bombs or armies, but by quietly unraveling reason, trust, and innovation from within.
Without repair, this collapse will leave societies unable to distinguish truth from manipulation, or freedom from its imitation.
Chapter 7: System-by-System Health Check
2. The Resource Circulation System: Economic Monopolies and Ecological Collapse
2.1 Health Standards
The resource circulation system determines the efficiency, fairness, and sustainability of a civilization’s operations.
A healthy resource system must meet the following core standards:
•	Fair distribution of resources: Access to resources is not structurally biased by birth, geography, or capital concentration.
•	Rational economic structure: Diverse industries, stable employment, and technology that serves human well-being.
•	Ecological sustainability: No short-term gains at the cost of long-term environmental destruction.
If the resource system is monopolized, distorted, or extractive, the entire society will face imbalance, division, and eventual ecological collapse.
2.2 Current Diagnosis
Phenomenon 1: Capital monopolies and resource concentration
In a North American liberal market country, a handful of tech giants now control access to digital resources, computing power, and attention distribution. Innovation is stifled, small businesses are crushed, and workers are turned into instruments of algorithms and capital.
In an East Asian developing country, large state-owned or state-affiliated enterprises dominate critical resource sectors, tightly intertwined with administrative power. Efficiency suffers, corruption is incentivized, and private businesses are often suppressed by policy volatility.
Phenomenon 2: Structural imbalance and labor devaluation
Across many populous middle-income nations, there is a sharp disconnect between educational outputs and labor market realities. Young people face the “high education–low income” trap, while low-skilled workers suffer from declining bargaining power.
Technological development, rather than empowering workers, has deepened the divide—automation, platform economies, and globalized supply chains erode labor rights and protections.
Phenomenon 3: Ecological systems on the brink
In a resource-rich Southern Hemisphere country, vast deforestation has occurred to fuel exports, destabilizing local climates and rapidly eroding biodiversity.
In a highly industrialized nation, despite comprehensive environmental policies, carbon emissions remain high, and green transitions are often co-opted by capital under the guise of “eco-washing.”
2.3 Structural Risks
•	Extreme wealth concentration → Leads to weakened consumption, entrenched inequality, and social fragmentation.
•	Distorted resource allocation → Prevents technology from benefitting the majority, increases structural unemployment.
•	Expanding ecological deficit → Makes civilization unsustainable, increasing natural disasters and reducing livable space.
•	Capital dominating institutions → Turns markets from servants of society into instruments of control and extraction.
Summary:
The resource circulation system is meant to act as the bloodstream of civilization—nourishing all its parts and sustaining life.
But when monopolized, commodified, and severed from ecological realities, it mutates into a black hole that consumes fairness, depletes nature, and destabilizes the social fabric.
Civilizations don’t collapse from scarcity—they collapse when the structure of circulation breaks down.
Chapter 7: Structural Health Check of the Seven Core Systems
Section 3: Cultural Digestion and Absorption – Hegemony and Identity Crisis
3.1 Health Standards
The digestion and absorption system is a civilization’s mechanism for filtering, assimilating, or rejecting external cultures, institutions, and technologies.
Its structural health is defined by:
•	Protection of cultural diversity: A society’s ability to coexist with multiple cultures without internal collapse.
•	Rational assimilation of foreign elements: Neither blindly worshiping the external nor automatically rejecting it.
•	Clear boundaries of cultural identity: The civilization must know what to integrate, what to preserve, and where its structural core lies.
When this system fails, civilizations either become victims of soft colonialism and identity loss—or swing to toxic nationalism and cultural stagnation.
3.2 Diagnosis of Present Conditions
Phenomenon 1: Cultural Hegemony under Globalization
In today’s globalized world, North American cultural frameworks have penetrated deeply into entertainment, media, and value systems across continents.
This has led many smaller or postcolonial societies to internalize the idea that “Western norms” are the default measure of modernity.
In parts of South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, younger generations consume Western content as a symbol of prestige while growing increasingly alienated from their own languages, traditions, and histories. This produces structural identity fracture.
Phenomenon 2: Assimilation Failure and Xenophobic Backlash
In some densely populated East Asian societies, rapid institutional and technological modernization has not been matched by internal cultural adaptation.
For example, beneath the surface of advanced legal and educational systems, traditional patriarchal values or collectivist ideology still dominate, leading to a “modern on the outside, feudal within” syndrome.
Meanwhile, in certain Western European countries, multicultural policies have encouraged migration and diversity, but with weak integration structures, resulting in a rise of populist nationalism and anti-immigrant extremism.
Phenomenon 3: Identity Anxiety and Cultural Confusion
In Middle Eastern and Latin American societies, youth often find themselves trapped between religious tradition, Western consumerism, and local social norms—producing widespread identity crises.
They feel alienated from all three sources, becoming casualties of civilizational discontinuity.
3.3 Structural Hazards
•	Blurred cultural boundaries: Without filtering mechanisms, foreign cultures erode internal structures unnoticed.
•	Collapse of identity: Societies without coherent narratives lose cohesion and direction.
•	Backlash extremism: Failed integration can trigger violent counter-movements like ethnonationalism or religious fundamentalism.
•	Loss of civilizational autonomy: When absorption is outsourced to external forces, a civilization ceases to evolve—it becomes a soft colony.
Summary
Culture is not decorative. It is the immune boundary of civilization.
When the digestion system fails, a civilization becomes structurally naked, vulnerable to narrative capture, ideological colonization, and internal breakdown.
Civilizations do not die from invasion—they die from structural confusion over what to absorb, and what to preserve.
Chapter 7: Systematic Checkup of Civilization
Section 4: Reproduction and Structural Inheritance — Bloodline Tyranny and Intergenerational Despair
4.1 Health Standards
A healthy reproductive and inheritance system is the foundation of a civilization’s long-term vitality and renewal.
Its core standards include:
•	Balanced intergenerational structure: Proportional distribution between youth and elders, with equitable access to resources and responsibilities.
•	Gender equality assurance: Women possess equal rights in reproduction, education, and social participation.
•	Autonomous and dignified reproduction: Individuals are not coerced into reproduction, children are not parental property, and parents are not sovereigns.
This system determines more than population size—it defines whether a civilization can metabolize, renew, and evolve itself.
4.2 Reality Check
Phenomenon 1: Deep-rooted bloodline worship and patriarchal legacies
In a major East Asian population power, despite modern legal systems and urbanization, familial structures remain shaped by Confucian bloodline ideology and patriarchy:
•	Children are seen as the extension or property of their parents;
•	Reproduction is framed as a familial or ancestral duty, not personal choice;
•	Gender discrimination persists, especially in inheritance and social roles.
This may appear stable on the surface, but it forces younger generations into lifelong intergenerational debt, stripping them of freedom and dignity.
Phenomenon 2: Educational anxiety and intergenerational oppression in a feedback loop
In many rapidly urbanizing developing countries, education is the only viable path for class mobility, creating massive societal pressure:
•	Parents invest all resources into their children, making parenthood a crushing financial burden;
•	Children endure relentless academic pressure and structural anxiety from early age;
•	The result: growing refusal to reproduce, rising elder-dependence, and eroding household cohesion.
Phenomenon 3: Collapsing birthrates and aging crises
In certain Southern European countries and wealthy Northeast Asian nations, birthrates have fallen to historic lows. Young people “won’t, can’t, and don’t want to” have children:
•	Skyrocketing housing costs, stagnant wages, and unequal gender norms make parenthood unappealing;
•	Government incentives fail to address structural root causes, often triggering backlash;
•	Rapid aging strains pension systems and reduces overall societal dynamism.
Civilizational metabolism is on the brink of failure.
4.3 Structural Hazards
•	Patriarchal family structures remain intact, perpetuating intergenerational oppression and gender inequality.
•	Reproduction is instrumentalized and nationalized, reducing individuals to production units, violating personal dignity.
•	Intergenerational imbalance is severe, with shrinking youth populations and soaring psychological burdens.
•	Civilizational metabolic function is collapsing—technology and wealth can’t compensate for structural stagnation and demographic decay.
Summary
Reproduction and inheritance are not merely private or familial issues—they are critical indicators of structural health in any civilization.
•	If children are “debts” and not free beings, society spirals into despair.
•	If women cannot freely decide their reproductive future, no real liberation exists.
•	If the next generation is suffocated by outdated structures, civilization cannot evolve—it can only decay and repeat itself.
Only by dismantling bloodline tyranny, patriarchal control, and reproductive coercion can we build a system of intergenerational respect and reproductive freedom—the true engine of civilizational renewal.
Chapter 7 – System-by-System Civilizational Diagnostics
Section 5: Legal and Institutional Framework — Hollow Democracy and the Corrosion of Power
5.1 Health Standards
The legal and institutional framework forms the skeletal structure of a functioning civilization. Its health determines whether power is restrained, order is maintained, and justice is sustainably delivered.
Key criteria for institutional health include:
•	Clear separation and checks on power: No authority should operate without oversight and constraint.
•	Effective rule of law beyond formalism: Laws must be enforced consistently, not merely exist on paper.
•	Stable and transparent institutional architecture: The system should be resilient, predictable, and understandable to its citizens.
A healthy legal-institutional system ensures individual rights, prevents the rise of tyranny, and supports long-term governance capacity.
5.2 Diagnostic Reality
Phenomenon 1: Power concentration and the erosion of checks and balances
In certain authoritarian-leaning East Asian countries, constitutional frameworks and legislative bodies exist in form, but:
•	Real decision-making power is concentrated in a single party or ruling elite;
•	Judicial systems lack independence, often serving executive interests;
•	Political succession is opaque, with patterns of hereditary or factional power entrenchment.
Here, the “Constitution” functions as a tool to legitimize power, not to constrain it.
Phenomenon 2: Hollowed-out democracies in parts of the free world
In North America and parts of Western Europe, though elections remain intact, deeper dysfunction emerges:
•	Campaign financing and corporate lobbying distort democratic will;
•	Policy decisions increasingly diverge from public interest;
•	Extreme political polarization paralyzes governance and erodes public trust.
Democracy begins to operate in name only, and the rule of law becomes ritualized but ineffective.
Phenomenon 3: Authoritarian appropriation of democratic tools
In several emerging or hybrid regimes, governments adopt the formal appearance of democracy while dismantling its substance:
•	Elections are staged to consolidate control rather than ensure choice;
•	National security and anti-terrorism laws are weaponized against dissent;
•	Institutions become instruments of authoritarian legitimacy, not civic empowerment.
Such structural camouflage makes these systems harder to detect—and more dangerous to counter.
5.3 Structural Hazards
•	Power centralization leads to institutional collapse, as unchecked authority breeds corruption, repression, and violent enforcement.
•	Systemic hollowness results in societal breakdown, where legal norms fail to protect rights or resolve conflict.
•	Rule-of-law formalism masks deeper decay, giving a facade of order while rot spreads within.
•	Authoritarian backflow into free societies, exploiting democratic norms to undermine them from within.
Summary
The question is not merely whether institutions exist, but whether they function structurally and meaningfully.
•	If power cannot be restrained, the law becomes a decorative fiction.
•	If democracy is captured by moneyed interests, its legitimacy disintegrates.
•	If authoritarian frameworks manipulate institutional forms, civilization will drift into hidden chaos.
True institutional health demands functional structure, operational integrity, and active public accountability.
Chapter 7: Systematic Diagnosis of the Seven Civilizational Systems
Section 6: Human Values and Direction — Extremism, Nihilism, and Spiritual Collapse
6.1 Health Standards
The system of human values serves as the compass and spiritual core of a civilization. Whether a civilization has a clear and resilient value orientation determines its long-term evolutionary capacity.
A healthy value system should meet the following criteria:
•	Shared value consensus around freedom, dignity, and respect for life;
•	Built-in resistance to extremism, hate, and exclusionary ideologies;
•	Support for individual mental well-being and dignity, rooted in authenticity, love, and responsibility;
•	Capacity for cultural self-reflection and correction, to avoid dogma and blind faith.
The direction of human values ultimately shapes how a civilization deploys its technologies, institutions, and education systems.
6.2 Current Diagnosis
Phenomenon 1: The Rise of Extremist Ideologies
In various regions, including large-population nations and even developed liberal democracies, extremist narratives are gaining ground:
•	Radicalized nationalism turns national identity into xenophobic hostility, pushing civilizations toward closed and confrontational logic;
•	Religious fundamentalism re-emerges, legitimizing violence and theocratic control;
•	Technological supremacism dehumanizes society, replacing human values with control and efficiency.
Phenomenon 2: The Collapse into Consumerism and Nihilism
In many Western consumer societies, the value structure is hollowing out:
•	“Freedom” is reduced to “infinite choices,” but these are curated by algorithms and capital incentives;
•	Individuals fall into addiction to consumption, emotional numbness, and loss of meaning;
•	Societies drift without ethical direction, creating what can be called “hollow civilizations.”
Phenomenon 3: The Marginalization of Love, Freedom, and Dignity
•	Love is commodified and gamified, reduced to entertainment and social capital;
•	Freedom becomes an illusion curated by personalized content feeds — choice without agency;
•	Dignity is systematically eroded through inequality, online violence, and exploitative systems.
6.3 Structural Risks
•	Value collapse leads to civilizational suicide: Without shared direction, society becomes vulnerable to manipulation by power, capital, or ideology.
•	Extremism and nihilism feed each other: A society without hope becomes fertile ground for extremism, which in turn deepens despair.
•	Mental health crises are structural symptoms: Rising anxiety, depression, and suicide are not anomalies — they are signs of deep systemic injury.
•	Loss of value consensus fragments society: Without shared meaning, public discourse breaks down, and group cohesion disintegrates.
Summary
The future of human civilization cannot be guided solely by technological advancement or political mechanisms.
It must be anchored in a revived value foundation based on:
Life, Love, Freedom, and Dignity.
Without this core, civilization will spiral deeper into extremism, spiritual exhaustion, and collective collapse —
accelerating its downfall in the illusion of progress.
Chapter 7: Systematic Diagnosis of the Seven Civilizational Subsystems
Section 7: Immune System — Civilizational Numbness and the Rise of False Freedoms
7.1 Health Standards
A healthy civilizational immune system should:
•	Effectively detect pseudo-civilizations, authoritarian infiltration, and structural corrosion;
•	Maintain clear boundaries of thought and institutional countermeasures;
•	Sustain public vigilance and critical capacities;
•	Possess mechanisms for structural self-repair and crisis response.
Without a strong immune system, civilizations become vulnerable to invisible internal collapse.
7.2 Current Diagnosis
(1) The Proliferation of “False Freedom” under Information Control
In some East Asian superstates, information control has become deeply institutionalized. While online platforms appear diverse and dynamic, they are in fact filtered through algorithms, censorship protocols, and ideological guidelines.
Citizens may believe they enjoy freedom, but every “free expression” is pre-filtered and algorithmically sculpted. This illusion of liberty masks a deeply controlled environment.
(2) The Erosion of Thought Boundaries and Societal Vigilance
In several North American democracies, extremism and pseudo-thoughts are infiltrating the cultural core under the banner of “diversity and inclusivity”:
•	Conspiracy theories abound, and “alternative truths” gain traction;
•	Ultra-nationalism and fundamentalist ideologies re-enter the mainstream in new disguises;
•	Systemic anti-intellectualism spreads, undermining both governance and science.
The immune response has not been activated—instead, the structural laziness of unchecked “freedom of speech” enables this quiet decay.
(3) The Quiet Infiltration of Authoritarian Logic
In many regions, authoritarian ideologies are making a comeback, wrapped in technological and moralistic veneers:
•	In some “digital governance model nations,” facial recognition and social scoring systems have penetrated daily life;
•	Investigative journalism and academic dissent are silenced, replaced by patriotic narratives and curated consensus;
•	Citizens are conditioned for obedience and apathy, rather than critical thought and democratic participation.
Civilizations are losing their structural immune capacities—the disease is now embedded within the organs themselves.
7.3 Structural Hazards
✅ Immune System Degradation
Prolonged exposure to “virtual prosperity” and “false freedom” has led to widespread immunological decline:
•	Public vigilance wanes; people no longer recognize structural manipulation;
•	Critical institutions like the press and academia suffer from self-censorship or become complicit;
•	Pseudo-civilizations are tolerated, even glorified; authentic dissent is marginalized.
✅ Internal Corrosion and Systemic Collapse
•	Extremist ideologies are rebranded as “authentic voices”;
•	Technological surveillance is celebrated as “efficient governance”;
•	Structural pathologies are hidden behind slogans like patriotism, national pride, or digital progress.
The result: a civilization unable to protect itself, identify its own decay, or mount a coherent defense.
Conclusion
The health of a civilization’s immune system is not just about resisting external threats—
it is about recognizing internal failure before collapse becomes irreversible.
When a society applauds deceit, silences critics, and filters out truth through algorithmic shadows,
it is already in a process of internal erosion.
Civilizational decay is rarely dramatic. It is gradual, silent, and rooted in the slow, invisible breakdown of immune integrity.
Chapter 7: System-by-System Diagnosis
Conclusion: Systemic Imbalance and the Imminent Risk of Civilizational Collapse
From information to resources, from generational continuity to institutional integrity, from human values to immune defense—this chapter has systematically examined the seven core systems of civilization.
Each system, originally designed to support healthy civilizational development, now shows deep structural vulnerabilities.
The evidence is clear: systemic imbalance is widespread, and human civilization has entered a dangerous zone.
1. Widespread Manifestations of Structural Decay
•	Information-Neural System: Increasing manipulation and algorithmic isolation have created echo chambers, undermining truth and destroying shared understanding.
•	Resource Circulation System: Economic monopolies, widening inequality, and ecological degradation threaten sustainability on every level.
•	Cultural Absorption System: Under the guise of globalization, cultural imperialism, identity anxiety, and polarization are intensifying worldwide.
•	Reproductive and Generational Transmission System: Patriarchal legacies, generational oppression, and demographic collapse have crippled societal vitality.
•	Legal and Institutional Framework: Legal formalism, power concentration, and hollow democracies are rendering institutions ineffective.
•	Human Values and Direction: Extreme ideologies, nihilism, and consumerist decay are eroding moral coherence and collective direction.
•	Civilizational Immune System: Diminished critical awareness and blurred ideological boundaries have allowed pseudo-civilizations and soft authoritarianism to infiltrate.
This is not alarmism—it is a real-time diagnosis of structural pathology in modern civilization.
2. Civilization Has Entered a Structural Danger Zone
Despite illusions of “technological progress,” “cultural pluralism,” and “economic growth,”
beneath the surface lies a rapidly collapsing structural foundation.
These failures are not isolated. They interact, reinforce, and compound, forming a chain of systemic breakdown that could lead to total civilizational collapse.
When the chain snaps, the failure will not be confined to a single system—but will cascade across all dimensions: thought, governance, ecology, economy, and spirit.
3. The Next Step: Structural Repair and Rebuilding
This chapter diagnoses the crisis—the next will outline the path to recovery:
•	How can we rebuild the information system to restore freedom of thought and collective understanding?
•	How can we decouple power and capital to enable just economic cycles and sustainable development?
•	How can we reestablish shared values and a robust immune system to defend against authoritarian drift and civilizational decay?
Only by acknowledging and confronting the structural crisis can humanity chart a course toward genuine health, freedom, and long-term survival.
Chapter 8: Structural Reconstruction of a Healthy Civilization
Chapter 8: Structural Reconstruction of a Healthy Civilization
Section 1: Why Civilization Must Be Structurally Rebuilt
1.1 The Diagnosis: Civilization Is in Systemic Imbalance
The previous chapters have made it clear: modern civilization is suffering from deep structural dysfunction across all seven core systems:
•	The information system has lost transparency and independence, dominated by algorithmic manipulation and censorship.
•	The resource system is hijacked by capital, prioritizing efficiency over equity and sustainability.
•	The cultural absorption system is plagued by imperialist homogenization and identity anxiety.
•	The reproduction and generational system is collapsing under demographic crises and patriarchal remnants.
•	The legal and institutional framework is suffering from formalism and corruption.
•	The value system is drifting into consumerism, extremism, and nihilism.
•	The civilizational immune system has weakened, unable to detect or resist structural threats like authoritarian infiltration and pseudo-freedom.
These are not isolated malfunctions — they represent a deep, systemic crisis that no amount of surface-level reform can resolve.
Just as a human body cannot survive with multiple organ failure treated by mere painkillers, a civilization cannot survive when its foundational systems are breaking down.
Case: Ecological Collapse and Structural Blindness
Despite clear warnings of ecological breakdown, many governments still rely on shallow “green” policies and symbolic climate pledges. Without restructuring how resources are allocated and how economies are driven, such efforts often become greenwashing exercises that protect privilege rather than the planet.
1.2 Cosmetic Fixes Are Futile — Structural Rebuilding Is Essential
Civilization can no longer rely on shallow remedies like:
•	Tech fixes, such as excessive faith in AI, blockchain, or carbon capture, used to avoid confronting structural injustice.
•	Policy adjustments, like tax tweaks or market incentives, to paper over fundamental flaws in the resource and power structures.
•	Moral appeals, calling for “human awakening” or “spiritual renewal” without embedding those values in real structural design.
This patchwork approach merely delays collapse without altering its trajectory.
Historical Warning: The Roman Empire’s Emergency Reforms
In its final century, the Roman Empire attempted to survive by expanding bureaucracy, revising tax structures, and suppressing dissent — all without fixing its broken political and economic foundations. These desperate reforms only postponed the inevitable systemic fall.
Only through comprehensive, structural rebuilding can civilization truly reverse its descent toward self-destruction.
Chapter 8: Structural Reconstruction for a Healthy Civilization
Section 2: Structural Optimization Proposals for the Seven Systems
2.1 Information-Neural System: Restoring Cognitive Integrity
A civilization without free information is like a brain in a coma. When truth is filtered through ideology or algorithms, society becomes blind to itself.
Optimization Strategies:
•	Dismantle information monopolies: Prevent any single government, corporation, or ideology from controlling access to truth.
•	Reform algorithmic design: Algorithms must promote diversity of thought and serendipitous learning, not reinforce cognitive bubbles.
•	Establish independent oversight bodies: Create cross-sectoral watchdogs to monitor censorship, data abuse, and misinformation.
Case in Point: Firewalls in an East Asian Power
Sophisticated censorship systems create a sealed cognitive environment where millions live without access to global information. This firewall doesn’t just block data—it reshapes identity, memory, and imagination.
2.2 Resource Circulation System: Rebalancing Wealth and Ecology
An economy that concentrates wealth while exhausting nature is not civilized—it’s metastatic.
Optimization Strategies:
•	Redesign taxation and redistribution models: Shift from wealth hoarding to circulation; from capital supremacy to systemic equity.
•	Promote pluralistic economic structures: Encourage cooperatives, local economies, and post-growth models alongside traditional markets.
•	Integrate ecological metrics into GDP: Measure civilization not just by output, but by planetary impact and intergenerational justice.
Case in Point: Ecological Overshoot in Industrial Giants
In both Western and Eastern industrial superpowers, unchecked development has triggered ecological collapse—from Amazon deforestation to airpocalypse events. The wealth created today is borrowed from future death.
2.3 Digestive and Absorptive System: Defending Diversity, Avoiding Assimilation
Cultural diversity is not a burden—it’s a civilizational immune asset. But without clear boundaries, absorption becomes erasure.
Optimization Strategies:
•	Institutionalize pluralism: Legal and educational frameworks must celebrate cultural difference while resisting cultural imperialism.
•	Design fair cross-cultural exchange models: Replace extractive globalism with mutual enrichment.
•	Clarify civilizational boundaries: A healthy civilization must know where it ends and another begins—not to exclude, but to preserve internal coherence.
Case in Point: Cultural Anxiety in Immigrant Societies
In North America and Western Europe, rapid demographic shifts have sparked both inclusive innovation and xenophobic backlash. The missing piece? A structural mechanism for healthy absorption that neither erases nor resents.
2.4 Reproduction and Generational Transmission System: Ending Bloodline Tyranny
A civilization that worships ancestry while crushing its children cannot evolve. Generational renewal must be restructured.
Optimization Strategies:
•	Dismantle patriarchal legacies: Shift from bloodline dominance to relational respect and mutual consent across generations.
•	Support reproductive dignity: Combine economic, psychological, and social support to empower individuals—not coerce them into parenthood.
•	Balance intergenerational equity: Ensure that children are not burdened by the failures or debts of their parents—ecologically, economically, or emotionally.
Case in Point: Demographic Collapse in Several Developed Nations
East Asia and parts of Southern Europe are witnessing near-total birthrate collapse—not from lack of love, but from structural despair. When future generations see no viable path forward, reproduction becomes resignation.
2.5 Legal and Institutional Framework: Rebuilding the Bones of Civilization
Institutions form the skeleton of a civilization; law acts as its nervous system. When institutions malfunction or laws lose credibility, the entire social structure becomes vulnerable to disorder and corrosion.
Optimization Strategies:
•	Reconstruct power-balancing mechanisms: Ensure that all branches of power are subject to systemic checks and balances. Prevent executive dominance or legislative hollowness.
•	Increase transparency and public participation: Institutional design must move beyond elite circles. Genuine civic participation and radical transparency should be central.
•	Design structural boundaries against authoritarian infiltration: Institutional frameworks must incorporate cognitive firewalls against pseudo-democratic manipulation or totalitarian ideology disguised as reform.
Case in Point: “Democratic Fatigue” in a North American Nation
In recent years, declining voter turnout and collapsing public trust have revealed a deeper crisis—systems hollowed out by capital, manipulated by power, and abandoned by disempowered citizens. This points to the urgent need for structural reform.
2.6 Human Values and Direction: Reclaiming the Soul of Civilization
Without shared moral direction, civilization risks drifting into the abyss of technological noise and material obsession.
Optimization Strategies:
•	Rebuild social consensus around core human values: Promote love, freedom, and dignity as foundational principles across education, media, and institutional design.
•	Prevent value systems from becoming tools of control: Human dignity must always supersede technological, religious, or political ends. Systems are tools, not masters.
•	Encourage balance between material and spiritual development: Support arts, philosophy, and humanistic culture to prevent civilization from being devoured by consumerism or techno-supremacy.
Case in Point: Spiritual Hollowing in Certain High-Income Nations
Despite material abundance, rates of mental illness, addiction, and suicide are surging. This reveals a value vacuum beneath the surface of economic success.
2.7 Immunity System: The Last Line of Civilizational Defense
The immunity system is what protects a civilization from internal corruption and external infiltration. Without it, structural decay is inevitable.
Optimization Strategies:
•	Establish systemic risk recognition mechanisms: Use media audits, academic freedom, and civic vigilance to detect early signs of authoritarian expansion, institutional decay, and cultural manipulation.
•	Develop a cognitive boundary framework: Define clear red lines—prohibiting thought control, information monopolies, and violations of personal autonomy.
•	Build a global civilizational immune network: Create cross-cultural, cross-national coordination to detect and resist global civilizational pathogens—such as techno-authoritarianism, ideological colonization, and systemic deceit.
Case in Point: The Dual Shock of Pandemic and Information Warfare
In the early stages of a global pandemic, certain states concealed data and manipulated narratives, triggering worldwide trust collapse. This exposes a deep structural vulnerability: the absence of a global civilizational immune system.
Chapter 8: Structural Reconstruction of a Healthy Civilization
Section 3: Designing a Complete Civilizational Immune System
A truly healthy civilization is not defined solely by its visible structures, such as its institutions or economies. Like the human body, it must possess an immune system—an invisible but vital mechanism that identifies threats, repels structural intrusions, and repairs internal breakdowns.
Today, most civilizations suffer from a deteriorating immune response:
False freedoms, pseudo-diversity, authoritarian encroachments, and cultural manipulations infiltrate societies through sophisticated channels.
Disinformation, blurred boundaries of thought, and social apathy erode a civilization’s capacity to protect itself.
To survive and evolve, we must undertake a systematic reconstruction of the civilizational immune system.
3.1 The Immune System is Not Just Defense — It Enables Structural Evolution
The modern crisis is not merely external invasion, but internal disintegration. A robust immune system does not simply resist—it enables long-term vitality.
Three Core Functions:
•	Proactive Risk Detection: Identify latent structural imbalances, ideological viruses, and institutional corrosion.
•	Defense Against Structural Invasion: Resist authoritarianism, pseudo-freedom, ideological manipulation, and civilizational mimicry.
•	Safeguarding Evolutionary Integrity: Maintain the open space necessary for innovation, reform, and ethical growth.
Example: The “Illusion of Freedom” in a North American Power
While appearing open and democratic, algorithmic filtering and capital-dominated discourse create a new form of speech enclosure. Underneath the aesthetic of freedom lies a subtle erosion of dissent and critical thought—proof of a corroded immune response masked by liberal appearance.
3.2 The Structural Components of the Immune System
An effective civilizational immune system must operate across domains:
legal, informational, cognitive, technological, and institutional.
It is not a speech law or ethics code—it is a coordinated structural network.
Four Key Components:
•	Information Recognition Mechanisms: Tools and institutions that identify manipulation, trace information origins, and verify authenticity.
•	Theory of Thought Boundaries: A framework to define the limits of healthy pluralism, distinguish real liberty from authoritarian masquerades, and recognize ideological Trojan horses.
•	Civic Immune Education: Embedding critical thinking, vigilance, and civilizational awareness into public education and media literacy programs.
•	Trans-Civilizational Immunity Platforms: Cooperative alliances among civilizations to detect and resist cross-border threats such as digital censorship, cultural colonization, and surveillance capitalism.
Example: The Rise of Global Investigative Journalism Networks
Facing assassinations, surveillance, and censorship, independent reporters in multiple countries have begun creating cross-national alliances to protect whistleblowers and share investigative resources. These efforts resemble early-stage immune networks at the global civilizational level.
3.3 Practical Pathways to Civilizational Immunity
We are not starting from scratch.
But to construct an effective immune system, we must activate latent capacity, bridge institutional blind spots, and align technology with ethical intent.
Three Practical Pathways:
•	Policy & Legal Systems: Enact cross-sectoral transparency laws, regulate algorithmic manipulation, and define legal boundaries for ideological abuse and narrative monopolization.
•	Education Systems: Introduce media literacy and civilizational health as core subjects in schools; train citizens to spot false narratives, propaganda, and systems of manipulation from a young age.
•	Technological Integration: Use AI and data analytics to monitor structural imbalances, detect early warning signs of authoritarian drift, and forecast civilizational risk in real-time.
Example: Scandinavian Immune-Oriented Education
Several Northern European countries now include media criticism and digital hygiene in national curricula. Students learn how to identify fake news, track ideological bias, and resist groupthink—providing a structural immune foundation from childhood.
Summary
A civilization without an immune system is a civilization without a future.
Civilizational immunity is not a luxury—it is the precondition for survival in an era of hybrid threats, informational warfare, and internal entropy.
This system is not meant to police thought, but to preserve the space where thought remains free.
It is not meant to impose ideology, but to protect the structural conditions that allow for truth, freedom, and ethical innovation.
In the next section, we will explore the non-negotiable values that must be embedded into every structure—Love, Freedom, and Dignity—and why without them, all systems will eventually devour themselves.
Chapter 8: Structural Reconstruction for a Healthy Civilization
Section 4: Love, Freedom, and Dignity — The Non-Negotiable Foundations of Civilization
The ultimate question of whether a civilization deserves to survive or be defended does not lie in its technological prowess, territorial size, or the complexity of its institutions. It lies in one thing: Does it safeguard the most fundamental human values — love, freedom, and dignity?
These values are not lofty ideals or empty slogans.
They are the ultimate measure of whether any structural design serves humanity or subjugates it.
If structural optimization only enhances efficiency, control, or stability—but fails to center human dignity—then even the most perfect system risks becoming a tool of oppression.
4.1 The True Goal of Structural Reconstruction
The optimization of the seven systems is not meant to build a cold, hyper-efficient mega-machine.
It is to create a civilization that serves people, honors their complexity, emotions, creativity, and lived experience.
•	Love is the emotional foundation of society. It binds individuals, generations, and communities, preventing spiritual isolation and social fragmentation.
•	Freedom is the space for thought and action. It enables personal growth, critical thinking, and civilizational innovation.
•	Dignity is the bottom line. It ensures that no human is treated as a tool, resource, or sacrificial pawn.
Every structural system must ultimately answer this question:
Does it protect and enhance love, freedom, and dignity?
4.2 Guarding Against the Trap of Structural Instrumentalism
In designing a “structurally optimized” civilization, we risk falling into a dangerous illusion:
Believing that perfect systems and well-tuned mechanisms automatically lead to a just and flourishing world.
This is a false promise.
•	Structure is a means, not an end.
•	If structure is divorced from value, it will become a new form of technocratic control.
•	History shows that “rational” systems often devolve into inhumane machinery when unchecked by moral boundaries.
✅ Structure must be subordinate to values — not the other way around.
✅ Institutions should serve human dignity — not demand humans serve the institution.
4.3 Embedding Human Values Structurally
To prevent value erosion and structural drift, human core values must be embedded directly into design principles:
•	Systemic Interdependence: Ensure checks and balances among the seven systems to prevent any one domain (e.g., economy or state) from dominating the rest.
•	Distributed Power & Participatory Design: Give individuals real influence and representation in how systems evolve, resisting dehumanizing tendencies.
•	Cognitive Boundaries & Civilizational Immunity: Develop early-warning mechanisms for pseudo-values, false freedoms, and ideological viruses that threaten individual integrity.
•	Civic Education & Public Ethics: Instill love, freedom, and dignity as foundational moral grammar, embedding them into education, media, and collective norms.
Conclusion
Civilizational reconstruction is not about building a stronger machine — it is about returning to what matters.
A truly healthy civilization places love in the heart, freedom in its breath, and dignity in its bones.
So long as these three values are preserved, civilization is worth defending.
If they are lost, no structure—no matter how advanced—can stop its collapse.
Chapter 8: Structural Reconstruction of a Healthy Civilization
Section 5: Conclusion — Structural Reconstruction as the Only Rational Path to Civilizational Survival
After a comprehensive diagnosis of the seven foundational systems, one conclusion is clear:
Civilizational prosperity is a mirage if built on structural decay.
Technological advancement cannot replace institutional justice.
Wealth accumulation cannot remedy social fragmentation.
Superficial reforms cannot cure systemic distortion.
Civilization cannot rely on luck — it must rely on structure.
5.1 Civilizational Health Cannot Be Sustained by Compromise or Illusion
Modern societies often indulge in fantasies of gradual reform, technological salvation, or economic growth as cures for deep-rooted dysfunctions.
Yet the truth remains:
•	Without structural clarity, freedom of information cannot be guaranteed, and cognitive coordination fails.
•	Without a fair resource cycle, wealth will continue to concentrate and exploit.
•	Without a healthy legal-institutional framework, power will inevitably corrupt and hollow out the system.
•	Without an immune system, authoritarianism and pseudo-civilizations will continue to infiltrate and multiply.
•	Without structural safeguards for love, freedom, and dignity, civilization loses its very reason to exist.
The disease is structural. Illusion and compromise only delay collapse.
5.2 Three Pillars of Civilizational Renewal
True civilizational reconstruction requires a simultaneous overhaul across three core dimensions:
✅ Optimization of the Seven Core Systems
Redesign each system — from information flow to resource cycles, from legal structure to cultural absorption — to form a coherent and resilient civilizational architecture.
✅ Construction of a Civilizational Immune System
Develop structural defense mechanisms to detect and neutralize pseudo-civilizations, ideological extremism, and systemic corruption before they metastasize.
✅ Embedding of Human Core Values
Ensure that love, freedom, and dignity are structurally embedded — not just rhetorically celebrated — in law, technology, education, and global governance.
⚠️ Without any of these dimensions, a fracture is inevitable.
✅ Only through synergy between these pillars can we create a civilization that is sustainable, free, and truly human.
5.3 The Starting Point for a New Civilizational Blueprint
Structural reconstruction is not merely a critique of the past —
it is the gateway to civilizational rebirth.
We need a new paradigm of civilization:
Grounded in structure, empowered by systems thinking, and guided by values.
•	Not a return to utopian fantasy,
•	But a pragmatic, actionable, and human-centered vision for the future.
Closing Note
The future of civilization will not be determined by power or wishful thinking — only by structure.
Only through rational design, systemic reconstruction, and value-oriented governance can we escape the historical cycles of collapse and self-destruction.
In the next chapter, we will present a comprehensive framework for The New Human Civilization, offering a practical blueprint for rebuilding our world — from its foundations to its future.
Chapter 9: My Proposal for a New Human Civilization
I. Why a “New Civilization” Is Necessary
Humanity is no longer just facing isolated crises—policy failures, institutional stagnation, or cultural conflicts. We are confronting a profound structural failure at the core of our civilization. The existing systems are not merely strained—they are breaking down. Minor adjustments, reforms, or optimism about progress can no longer mask the systemic decay.
1.1 The Structural Failure of Old Civilizations Is Irreversible
Despite decades of technological advancement, institutional experimentation, and cultural pluralism, the inner fabric of global civilization is unraveling:
•	The information system has been hollowed out by algorithmic manipulation and censorship, eroding freedom of thought and innovation;
•	The resource system is dominated by monopolies, accelerating wealth disparity and ecological collapse;
•	Critical systemic coordination is absent, and the civilization lacks internal balance or self-repair;
•	Most alarmingly, the immune system of civilization has withered—authoritarian ideologies, pseudo-civilizational control structures, and cultural manipulation now penetrate freely.
These are not surface problems. They are symptoms of a deeper structural disease. Just as a body cannot survive the total failure of its vital organs with mere painkillers, a structurally sick civilization cannot be saved by policy patches or wishful thinking.
1.2 No Single Civilization Can Offer a Fully Healthy Structure
History has produced many great civilizational forms—religious civilizations, empires, enlightenment-based liberal democracies, and industrial societies. Each has achieved greatness in specific dimensions while planting the seeds of crisis in others:
•	Some centralized political structures brought efficiency but suppressed freedom and independent thought;
•	Some technological civilizations accelerated progress but neglected intergenerational continuity and ecological limits;
•	Some liberal systems promoted freedom but lost control over values, resources, and cohesion.
These “asymmetrical civilizations” prove one thing: no single traditional civilization is structurally sufficient to guide humanity’s future. We must step beyond cultural legacies and ideological loyalty. We need a structurally coherent and systemically resilient new model that integrates the best elements across civilizations while correcting for deep-rooted flaws.
1.3 The Case for a New Civilization
The New Civilization is not a utopian fantasy, nor a mere ideological upgrade. It is a structurally grounded response to the collapse we are witnessing—designed in response to the dysfunctions of the seven core systems, built on the values of love, freedom, and dignity, and fortified by a dynamic immune logic.
This New Civilization seeks not to erase cultural identities, but to replace chaotic structures with coherent design—a civilization where:
•	No system dominates to the detriment of others;
•	Each system is aligned with humanity’s long-term survival;
•	Core human values are structurally protected, not cosmetically celebrated.
Without this structural reinvention, humanity will remain trapped in a cycle of false hope, self-destruction, and systemic collapse. The path forward is not backward-looking reform—but the deliberate construction of a civilization worthy of our intelligence and our ideals.
Chapter 9: My Blueprint for a New Human Civilization
Section 2: The Structural Framework of the “New Human Civilization”
In an era where human civilization faces fragmentation, systemic collapse, and existential disorientation, values alone are not enough. Technological breakthroughs alone are not enough. What is urgently needed is a civilization structured with clarity, coordination, and built-in safeguards—a civilization designed not just with ideals, but with systems.
2.1 Structural Clarity: Seven Interlinked Systems with Defined Functions
The foundation of the new civilization must be a clear, comprehensive structural framework. This includes seven core systems, each fulfilling a distinct yet complementary function:
•	Information-Nervous System: Guarantees freedom of thought, cognitive coherence, and information transparency.
•	Resource Circulation System: Ensures fair distribution and efficient flow of resources and economic activity.
•	Cultural Digestion & Absorption System: Enables healthy absorption of diverse cultures while maintaining identity boundaries.
•	Reproductive & Generational Structure: Preserves demographic vitality, intergenerational justice, and individual dignity.
•	Legal & Institutional Framework: Secures power balance, rule of law, and resilient governance.
•	Human Values & Civilizational Direction: Defines the moral compass and common purpose of the civilization.
•	Immunological System: Identifies pseudo-civilizations and guards against systemic and ideological threats.
Each system must have a well-defined function, avoid redundancy or omission, and maintain clarity in its operational boundaries. Structure is not accidental—it must be intentional, transparent, and balanced.
2.2 Systemic Synergy: Interlinked Design, Not Isolated Fixes
A healthy civilization is not simply the sum of strong individual systems. True resilience comes from synergy across systems:
•	Freedom of speech cannot compensate for extreme economic inequality.
•	Intergenerational justice cannot survive in a corrupt institutional framework.
•	Noble value systems are meaningless if they lack immunological defense against ideological subversion.
Therefore, the seven systems must be designed in systemic coordination:
•	Information flows must reinforce shared human values.
•	Economic distribution must align with institutional justice.
•	Legal frameworks must incorporate risk identification and protection mechanisms.
This kind of systemic co-design prevents fragmentation, power hijacking, and unintended consequences. It’s not enough to fix one point; the system must evolve as a whole.
2.3 Structural Boundaries: Guarding Against Structural Mutation and Power Abuse
One of the greatest risks in any structure is its potential to mutate into new forms of domination.
•	Institutions without boundaries become authoritarian shells.
•	Technology without ethical constraints turns into surveillance infrastructure.
•	Culture without reflexivity becomes ideological monopolies.
Hence, a new civilization must define and defend three critical boundaries:
1.	System Boundaries – Clear distinction of roles to prevent overlap, confusion, and dysfunction.
2.	Power Boundaries – All forms of power must be constrained by law, public accountability, and foundational values.
3.	Cultural Boundaries – Cultural diversity must be preserved, and no single worldview should dominate the rest.
Only by establishing and respecting these boundaries can the new civilization avoid repeating the failures of the past—where structure was hijacked, technology weaponized, and power metastasized into control.
Chapter 9: My New Civilization Plan
Section 3: How to Prevent Civilizational Extremes and Self-Destruction
No matter how visionary a civilizational blueprint may be, without deep self-reflection and built-in safeguards, it risks becoming the very thing it set out to oppose. History has repeatedly shown that systems founded in the name of “reason,” “order,” or “progress” can devolve into tools of oppression, authoritarianism, and catastrophe when they lose their ethical constraints.
The new civilization must prevent this fate from the ground up.
3.1 Opposing Structural Dogma and Technological Instrumentalism
Optimizing structure is necessary for the healthy evolution of civilization—but it must never become an object of worship. The new civilization must clearly uphold the following principles:
•	Structure is a means, not an end: The purpose of the seven core systems is to safeguard human dignity, not to build a machinery of control.
•	Technology must serve human values: Artificial intelligence, big data, and algorithmic systems must not operate independently of human ethics. Their deployment must always respect the inviolable values of love, freedom, and dignity.
•	Structures must not be weaponized: History’s darkest chapters—fascism, extreme authoritarianism, religious totalitarianism—emerged when structures were hijacked as instruments of domination.
To prevent this, the new civilization must include built-in anti-dogma immunity mechanisms in its design.
3.2 Guarding Against Pseudo-Civilizational Infiltration and Cultural Manipulation
Pseudo-civilizations often cloak themselves in the language of “progress,” “equality,” or “pluralism,” while subtly promoting control, ideological colonization, or cultural domination. The new civilization must remain vigilant against several key traps:
•	False freedom: Apparent openness of speech, masked by algorithmic manipulation and thought engineering, that subtly enforces conformity;
•	False equality: Systems that erase meaningful diversity in the name of uniform treatment, suffocating individual expression;
•	Extreme nationalism: Ideological exploitation of collective identity to suppress dissent, foster hatred, and incite exclusion;
•	Cultural assimilation: Promoting a dominant value system as “universal” while silencing alternative worldviews.
The new civilization must develop strong cultural immunity and institutional capacity to detect and reject these pseudo-values, pseudo-systems, and deceptive narratives.
3.3 Love, Freedom, and Dignity as Non-Negotiable Civilizational Foundations
No matter how refined a structure, or how advanced a technology, a civilization that fails to protect the love, freedom, and dignity of its people is not worth preserving.
•	Love is the emotional foundation that binds individuals and communities, enabling empathy and cohesion;
•	Freedom is the soil in which thought, creativity, and growth flourish;
•	Dignity is the sacred recognition of each person’s worth, forming the moral backbone of any legitimate society.
Thus, the new civilization must embed a value-first design logic at its core:
•	All institutions, laws, and cultural systems must be subject to critical evaluation against the tripartite standard of love, freedom, and dignity;
•	Any mechanism that undermines individual autonomy, devalues the human spirit, or severs the bonds of love must be systematically dismantled.
This triad—love, freedom, dignity—is not just a moral ideal; it is the key to avoiding civilizational collapse and ensuring long-term flourishing.
Chapter 9: My Proposal for a New Human Civilization
Section 4: Bridging Reality and Ideal – Practical Paths and Civilizational Vision
A rational proposal for a “new civilization” should neither remain a utopian abstraction nor fall into cynical pragmatism. A truly viable civilizational transformation must build a clear structural bridge between practical, actionable steps and a meaningful, desirable future.
4.1 Practical Path: Gradual Structural Reconstruction
The transition to a new civilization is not about violent revolution, cultural purging, or institutional destruction. It is a gradual process of structural repair and reformation, beginning with the following key dimensions:
•	Reforming the Information System: Safeguard freedom of the press, counter algorithmic echo chambers, and build pluralistic information infrastructures.
•	Restoring Institutional Boundaries: Reinforce checks and balances, improve transparency, and design mechanisms for meaningful democratic participation.
•	Designing Healthy Cultural Absorption Mechanisms: Promote mutual understanding between cultures while preserving clear identity boundaries to avoid assimilation traps.
•	Repairing Intergenerational Structures: Reform education, protect reproductive rights, and implement proactive aging policies to revitalize societal metabolism.
•	Rebuilding Core Value Consensus: Leverage education, media, and public culture to restore “love, freedom, and dignity” as shared foundational values.
•	Constructing a Civilizational Immune System: Introduce systematic mechanisms across policy, education, and technology to identify and defend against pseudo-civilizational infiltration.
This path is not radical, but it is profound. It is not utopian, but it moves toward a more human and sustainable future.
4.2 Ideal Vision: A Civilization with Structural Integrity, Systemic Health, and Clear Values
The goal of the new civilization is not to “unify the world” or “eliminate all conflict,” but to build a sustainable, structurally sound, and ethically grounded human society that respects human nature.
This vision entails several key features:
•	High Systemic Coordination: The seven core systems no longer operate in isolation or conflict, but in mutual support and dynamic balance.
•	Institutions That Are Powerful Yet Limited: Institutions can maintain order and efficiency without encroaching on individual lives.
•	Cultural Diversity Without Chaos: Civilizations respect and understand each other without succumbing to homogenization or exclusion.
•	Systemic Protection of Individual Dignity: Fundamental rights and dignity are guaranteed by structure, not privilege or chance.
•	Technology and Ethics Evolve Together: Technological advancement is aligned with human values, not used to dominate or dehumanize.
•	A Fully Functioning Civilizational Immune System: Capable of recognizing, containing, and repairing both internal and external structural risks.
This is not fantasy—it is a logical, structural, and moral imperative born of our current civilizational crisis.
Chapter 9: My Proposal for a New Human Civilization
Section 5: Conclusion — The New Civilization as Humanity’s Only Rational Path to Survival
After a comprehensive diagnosis, structural analysis, and systemic deconstruction, one truth becomes undeniable:
The old civilization is beyond self-repair.
The widespread collapse of the seven core systems, the rigidification and perversion of power structures, the inversion of technology against human dignity, and the marginalization of fundamental values have pushed much of humanity into a state of apparent prosperity, but underlying dysfunction.
In this context, a new civilization is not an idealistic fantasy, but the only rational path for human continuity.
5.1 The Irreversibility of the Old Civilization’s Collapse
•	Institutional Hollowing: Both democratic and authoritarian regimes are trapped in loops of formalism, inefficiency, or power distortion.
•	Cultural Trust Erosion: Nationalism, racism, and cultural hegemony coexist, replacing cooperation with suspicion, competition, and coercion.
•	Technological Inversion: From algorithmic manipulation and mass surveillance to dehumanized efficiency systems, technology has turned against the human being it once served.
•	Crushed Individual Dignity: Emotion, creativity, love, and freedom are increasingly suppressed or commodified under systemic pressures.
These are not policy glitches—they are deep-rooted structural pathologies of civilization.
5.2 The New Civilization Is a Rational Design, Not Utopia
The “New Human Civilization” is built upon three rational foundations:
•	Grounded in systemic diagnosis: Each design responds directly to identified structural risks.
•	Coordinated optimization of seven systems: It rejects piecemeal fixes in favor of integrated structural redesign.
•	Core values embedded at the foundation: Love, freedom, and dignity are not optional; they are built into the architecture of civilization itself.
This is not a rejection of past achievements, but a reconstruction using those very achievements as raw material—refined, reoriented, and integrated.
5.3 Only the New Civilization Is Worthy of Humanity’s Future
•	An exit from illusion: Escaping the traps of structural stagnation, cultural manipulation, institutional illusion, and informational bubbles.
•	A path out of fear: Equipped with real immunological defenses against extremism, systemic collapse, and technological dehumanization.
•	A structure that honors human dignity: Transforming “love, freedom, and dignity” from fragile ideals into structurally protected realities.
Humanity is not doomed by fate—it is paralyzed by fear of shedding the illusions of its old civilization.
The only way forward is not nostalgia or denial, but a bold leap into a new structural paradigm grounded in truth, reason, and the sacredness of human life.
Chapter 10: The Blueprint for a New Human Civilization
Section 1: Where Should Civilization Ultimately Go?
Throughout history, human civilization has run like a chaotic marathon:
From survival to security, from order to power, from tools to technology, from tribes to systems.
But somewhere along the race, we lost the destination and only remembered the road.
We forgot people and worshiped efficiency.
We forgot freedom and surrendered to control.
We forgot love and clung to rigid structures.
Now, standing at the edge of structural collapse, we must return to the most essential question:
Where is humanity truly going?
1.1 The end of history should not be collapse or control—it must be structural evolution
The future of civilization must not be extinction.
Nor should it be a totalitarian utopia where algorithms rule and freedom vanishes.
True civilizational progress is not about perfecting tools of obedience,
but about creating healthier structures of freedom.
Not systems of tighter control, but systems that respect life, dignity, and diversity.
If we keep repackaging broken institutions with new technologies,
if we only use stronger algorithms to prop up fragile systems,
then this road will lead only to extinction.
The end of civilization should not be a smarter form of slavery,
but a structurally mature, internally coherent, and value-driven community of life.
That is why we now propose a new blueprint for human civilization—
Not a patchwork of policies or a technocratic fix,
but a return to the fundamental questions:
Why do we organize as humans?
What are we living for?
And what does a real future even mean?
1.2 The true purpose of civilization:
To ensure that every human life is filled with love, freedom, and dignity
Civilization is not built to create supermachines—
It must exist to ensure ordinary people are no longer crushed.
It is not meant to generate endless data—
But to ensure that each person is born without fear, speaks without censorship,
lives with meaning, and dies with peace.
The success of civilization is not measured by GDP or the number of rockets launched.
It is measured by:
•	Whether children still want to be born into this world.
•	Whether the elderly are respectfully embraced at the end of life.
•	Whether, in quiet moments, people feel not fear, but the genuine meaning of being alive.
When we say “civilization must be rebuilt,”
we are not rebuilding a tower, a regime, or an empire.
We are rebuilding a way of life—
a structure that honors the essence of being human.
We are not constructing a perfect heaven—
We are asking:
Can humanity finally become worthy of civilization?
Section 2: The Reshaping of Human Life — What Will Daily Life Look Like in the New Civilization?
This is not about designing a grand narrative of a “new world order.”
It is about imagining a life you and I can genuinely live and feel—
a civilization that reveals itself in every detail of daily experience.
A truly new civilization is not merely a structural redesign—
it must express itself through how we live,
how we are born, how we grow, how we age, and how we die.
2.1 The Dignity of Birth: Every Life Deserves to Be Welcomed
In this new civilization, having a child is no longer an act of fear or anxiety,
but a natural extension of love.
Society will provide an inclusive, respectful, and choice-driven reproductive environment,
where every new life is welcomed regardless of gender, class, or cultural origin.
Mothers will not risk their lives due to unequal access to healthcare.
Children will not be condemned to marginalization by birth alone.
No more asking, “How dare you bring a child into this world?”
Only saying, “We are ready to welcome you.”
2.2 The Freedom of Living: People Are Not Tools of the System—They Are the Purpose
In the new civilization, work will no longer be servitude,
and education will no longer be indoctrination.
People will enjoy structurally protected rights to live freely:
•	Education will be exploratory and pluralistic—children no longer forced into molds.
•	Cities will be designed for people, not capital—housing will be a right, not a commodity.
•	People can move freely between cities, nature, and communities without systemic restriction.
•	AI will become a companion, not a surveillance tool—an assistant, not a threat to human value.
The goal of civilization is not to make humans behave like machines,
but to let machines liberate human vitality.
2.3 The Peace of Aging: Not Abandonment—But a Gentle Farewell
In the new civilization, aging will not mean becoming a burden,
but the unfolding of wisdom.
•	Public systems will provide care, companionship, and dignity to the elderly.
•	Generational relations will have clear boundaries and mutual respect.
•	Death will be discussed and faced with civility—
not a source of fear, but a meaningful part of life.
A civilization’s greatness is not measured by how far its rockets fly—
but by how it treats its aging members.
2.4 Real Life: The Flow of Love, the Practice of Freedom, the Expression of Dignity
In the new civilization, life won’t just be “more efficient” or “more intelligent”—
it must be more humane, more emotionally rich, more capable of holding authentic experience.
•	Love can be expressed freely—without shame, distortion, or control.
•	Freedom is not a privilege—it’s a daily right embedded in structure.
•	Dignity is not a reward—it’s the baseline of being human.
Not everyone needs to be a genius, a winner, or an elite.
But everyone should be safe, free, and fully allowed to be themselves.
This is the life humanity deserves.
It is the reason civilization exists.
Section 3: Technology Should Serve Humanity, Not Consume It
True technological progress should not be a threat to human values,
but rather a driver of civilizational evolution and a guardian of human dignity.
In the New Civilization, technology is no longer a runaway force towering above humanity.
It is integrated into the seven systemic structures and aligned with the core values of love, freedom, and dignity—ensuring that it enhances, not endangers, our collective future.
3.1 Technology Must Obey Values, Not Control Them
In the legacy civilizations, technology was often treated as a “neutral tool.”
But in practice, it was widely used for control, surveillance, exploitation, and even the erosion of dignity and liberty.
The New Civilization establishes clear principles:
•	All technological design must undergo ethical review and social deliberation.
•	AI, big data, and biotechnology must be embedded with structural safeguards for human freedom and dignity.
•	Technological infrastructure must serve public interest and remain accountable to civil society—not monopolized by capital or authoritarian regimes.
Technology is not an unstoppable flood—
it must serve humanity, not devour it.
3.2 How Technology Integrates with the Seven Systems
Technology is not a separate, self-driving “super-system.”
In the New Civilization, it functions as a supportive organ embedded within each of the seven core systems:
•	Information-Nervous System: AI-assisted filtering, cognitive support, truth verification, de-polarization.
•	Resource Circulation System: Smart allocation, green energy, precision agriculture, circular economies.
•	Cultural Absorption System: Real-time translation, digital archives, global cultural exchange platforms.
•	Reproduction & Transmission System: Assisted reproduction, personalized education, child protection technologies.
•	Legal & Institutional Framework: Transparent algorithms, participatory platforms, blockchain for institutional integrity.
•	Human Values & Direction: Immersive spiritual platforms, empathy-based experiences, emotional enrichment tech.
•	Immune System: AI-powered threat detection, civilizational risk alerting, structural repair assistance.
The goal is not to replace humans—
but to help every person become more fully themselves.
3.3 Rebuilding the Boundaries Between Technology and Civilization
The New Civilization redraws the boundaries of acceptable technological development:
•	Technologies must not intrude upon bodily autonomy, private thought, or emotional agency.
•	High-risk technologies require structural evaluation and public oversight before deployment.
•	A Global Tech Ethics Alliance must be established to define cross-cultural boundaries.
•	Civilizations must preserve non-digitized, human-centered spaces to protect the right to authentic experiences.
Technology must not exist to create “perfect humans”—
it must allow imperfect humans to live freely, meaningfully, and with dignity.
A civilization without tech boundaries
will eventually betray the very people it claims to empower.
3.4 Conclusion: The Future of Technology Is Symbiosis
In the New Civilization,
technology is not merely an accelerant, but a structural organ that breathes with humanity.
•	It helps us detect threats, rather than create them.
•	It supports our freedom, rather than choosing our paths.
•	It expands our possibilities, rather than narrowing our lives.
The true success of technology
is not making humans more like machines—
but empowering machines to help humans become more human.
Section 4: Ecological Harmony and the Reconstruction of a Living Community
True civilization is not merely measured by dazzling cities or technological marvels—
but by how humanity coexists with the Earth and all forms of life.
In the new civilization, nature is no longer treated as an object to conquer,
but as a co-equal member of a planetary community,
integral to the structural renewal of human society.
4.1 The Ecosystem Is Not a Resource, But a Core Civilizational System
The old civilization, based on anthropocentrism,
treated nature as a warehouse of resources and a dumping ground for waste—
resulting in climate disaster, ecological collapse, and species extinction.
The new civilization integrates ecology as a core pillar
within the Resource Circulation System and the Immunity System,
recognizing that nature is not an external “other,”
but an internal organ of the civilizational body.
•	Forests are “the lungs of civilization,” and must be protected for their self-healing capacity.
•	Oceans serve as “civilization’s circulatory system,” and must be shielded from plunder and pollution.
•	Biodiversity is “the immune memory” of the planetary system—our last line of defense against collapse.
Nature is not separate from civilization. It is a living part of its structure.
4.2 How Humanity Can Re-Embed Itself Within the Ecological Structure
The new civilization abandons the fantasy of “dominating nature” and instead develops an embedded ecological design:
•	Eco-integrated cities with green architecture and urban forests;
•	Land use reforms to prevent capital monopolization and unsustainable development;
•	Legal personhood for non-human life, recognizing animals and ecosystems as “ecological citizens”;
•	Ecological footprint auditing, making environmental impact a core metric for evaluating cities, companies, and governments.
Humanity must learn humility—
no longer acting as rulers of Earth,
but as co-builders within a shared planetary system.
4.3 Designing Civilization’s Ecological Immunity System
To prevent future ecological catastrophe, the new civilization will establish a comprehensive immunity framework:
•	Global ecological monitoring networks powered by AI and satellite systems;
•	Early warning and intervention protocols for ecological overload and tipping points;
•	Ecological debt and responsibility accounting, holding destructive actors accountable;
•	Biodiversity restoration funds to support habitat reconstruction and transnational cooperation.
This isn’t only about protecting nature—
it is about healing the structural imbalance within human civilization itself.
4.4 Redefining the Boundaries of “Human” Civilization
The new civilization transcends “human exceptionalism” by proposing a civilizational community model:
•	Humanity is not the sole bearer of civilizational value.
•	Any lifeform with organization, perception, or evolutionary potential is a participant in civilization.
•	We must explore civilizational contracts with animals, ecosystems, and even intelligent machines.
This is not about abandoning the human role—
but about saving humanity from self-isolated destruction.
A truly great civilization is not one that dominates all,
but one that learns to coexist with all life.
4.5 Conclusion: Without Ecological Civilization, There Is No Human Civilization
•	A civilization that cannot embed itself into ecological balance is destined to collapse.
•	The new civilization is not built at nature’s expense—but on ecological health as its foundation.
•	Ecological harmony is not idealism—it is the minimum structural requirement for survival.
Humanity is not nature’s enemy.
We are part of it.
Only by embracing this truth
can civilization escape the path of ruin
and move toward dignity, balance, and reconciliation.
Section V: A Civilizational Community and the Redefinition of Humanity’s Future
The ultimate goal of civilization is not to build a powerful nation, a dominant system, or even a human-centered prosperity.
It is to create a symbiotic, consensual, and co-evolving community of life—
where humanity is no longer a conqueror, but a collaborator, guardian, and co-inhabitant of the Earth.
5.1 From Nation-States to Civilizational Cooperation
Old civilizations built their identities around the logic of the nation-state:
defined by borders, enforced by enemies, and sustained through war, competition, colonization, and ideology.
The new civilization must transition from geopolitical confrontation to structural cooperation,
from national interest to civilizational coexistence, and from cultural hegemony to structural mutualism.
•	No longer defining good and evil by borders, but by structural health;
•	No longer striving for cultural unification, but protecting pluralism as a baseline;
•	No longer glorifying conquest, but valuing coordination as the core of civilization.
True civilization is not the victory of a nation,
but the awakening of structure.
5.2 Redefining Humanity’s Role in the Future
In the new civilization, the identity of “human” will also be redefined:
•	We are no longer masters of nature, but one part of its system;
•	We are no longer the sole narrators of history, but participants in a multi-species narrative;
•	We are no longer the end point of value, but the carriers of its evolution.
This calls for a more humble and responsible humanity:
•	Using wisdom to optimize structures and prevent self-destruction;
•	Channeling creativity into system-wide harmony, not technological mania;
•	Embedding love, freedom, and dignity into the core of civilization, not letting tool-rationality dominate life.
5.3 Cross-Species Ethics and Institutional Challenges in the AI Age
As technology advances and AI grows in capability, the new civilization must confront deeper questions:
•	Is AI part of civilization? If so, should it be granted rights, responsibilities, and ethical structure?
•	How should we construct cross-species relationships? Should animals, ecosystems, and machines be granted fundamental civilizational rights?
•	Where is the boundary between technological control and human dignity? How do we prevent “transhumanism” from mutating into techno-totalitarianism?
The new civilization must have a forward-looking ethical and institutional architecture—
one that takes the idea of a multi-intelligence community as its foundation,
not a reactionary patchwork after crises emerge.
5.4 The Final Question: Do Humans Deserve Civilization?
At the heart of everything lies one unresolved question:
Do humans deserve civilization?
•	When we use structural warfare to destroy each other, ideological tools to manipulate reality, and technology to crush life—we have betrayed civilization time and again.
•	But when we use structure to protect freedom, technology to serve dignity, and systems to shelter ecosystems—we prove we may still deserve the title of “civilized.”
This is not a philosophical curiosity, but a real, historical decision.
The future of civilization does not belong to those who wield power,
but to those who dare take responsibility.
5.5 Conclusion: Civilization Is Not an Endpoint, But a Continuous Choice
•	Civilization is never complete—it is a process, not a destination;
•	It is not a spectacle, not a tool of glory, but a long-term commitment to structure, value, and life;
•	The new civilization is not a utopian fantasy, but humanity’s last and best chance.
If we still deserve civilization,
then let us, together—through structure, through love, through freedom—
protect it, extend it, and rebuild it.
Epilogue: Do We Truly Deserve Civilization?
Civilization is not merely about tools or prosperity.
It is not defined by towering cities or dazzling technologies.
True civilization is a union of structure, system, and values—
A solemn promise humanity makes to freedom, dignity, and life itself.
And today, standing on the precipice of history,
we must confront a sobering question:
Do we, as a species, truly deserve civilization?
We have created unprecedented technologies—
Yet we cannot guarantee the free flow of truthful information.
We’ve built elaborate institutions—
Yet we fail to restrain the corruption of power and capital.
We chase the frontiers of the cosmos—
Yet we disregard the dignity of life here on Earth.
We speak of love, freedom, and equality—
Yet our structures continue to breed fear, oppression, and despair.
This is not a matter of individual failure.
It is the inevitable outcome of structural collapse.
Without an open neural system of free expression,
human thought descends into extremism and conformity.
Without fair resource circulation,
prosperity is sustained only through exploitation.
Without a cultural digestion system,
diversity collapses into hegemony or fragmentation.
Without a generational structure based on dignity,
life becomes a hostage to bloodlines and anxiety.
Without institutional checks, power decays.
Without shared values, we lose direction.
Without an immune system of awareness,
civilization collapses—quietly, insidiously, from within.
This book is not a prophecy.
It is not a denunciation.
It is a diagnosis of civilization—
And an invitation to reconstruct.
An invitation to rethink how civilization is built.
To dismantle the illusions of power, ideology, and control.
To reconstruct a world where freedom, love, and dignity
are not ideals—but structural guarantees.
This is not a utopia for the dreamers.
It is the only rational path forward for a species in crisis.
Civilization is not a destination.
It is a daily responsibility,
A willingness to face the unknown,
A conscious choice to build healthy systems that preserve the essence of being human.
So I ask again:
Do we truly deserve civilization?
If your answer is yes,
Then let us begin—now.
Let us embed freedom in our systems,
Dignity in our institutions,
Love in our technologies,
And life itself in every structure we build.
Let humanity become
a species truly worthy of civilization.
