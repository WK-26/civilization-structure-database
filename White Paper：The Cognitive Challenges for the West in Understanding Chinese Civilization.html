<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>This white paper aims to provide the Western world with a structured analytical framework that goes beyond the conventional lenses of “cultural exchange” or “state-to-state relations.” Its purpose is to enable a deep understanding of the underlying architecture and long-term operational mechanisms of Chinese civilization—preventing policymakers, scholars, and the public from being misled by its cultural, economic, or diplomatic façades, and from underestimating the structural risks it poses to free societies.</p>
<p>Chinese civilization is not merely a historical culture or an ethnic identity, nor is it solely the product of any contemporary regime. It is a civilizational structure—one that has evolved over thousands of years, with power concentration and hierarchical order as its highest organizing principles. This structure can survive within, adapt to, and embed itself in vastly different political systems and economic models, all while preserving its core mechanisms of control.</p>
<p>The intended audience for this white paper includes policymakers, scholars, think tanks, journalists, international organizations, and activists committed to the global cause of freedom and democracy. For them, recognizing the structural nature of Chinese civilization is a prerequisite for developing effective strategies against structural colonialism and “silent conquest.”</p>
<p>Only by understanding this civilizational architecture can the Western world anticipate its expansionary mechanisms, identify potential threats, and construct an effective civilizational immune system—one capable of safeguarding the values and institutional foundations upon which free societies depend.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1｜Problem Overview: Why the West Struggles to Understand Chinese Civilization</h2>
<p>1.1 Misalignment Between Appearance and Substance</p>
<p>English Version</p>
<p>Argument Introduction</p>
<p>In most Western political, academic, and media discourse, “China” is understood as a modern nation-state of 1.4 billion people, whose differences lie merely in governance style or value preferences. This analytical framework mirrors the way the West once approached the Soviet Union, Iran, or Turkey—treating China as a political regime rather than a “civilizational-structural entity” that survives dynastic changes and adapts to different systems.</p>
<p>This misalignment leads Western actors to react to surface-level issues (human rights, trade, military expansion) while overlooking the underlying civilizational structural mechanisms that drive China’s behavior.</p>
<p>Case Studies</p>
<p>1.	WTO Accession and Market Access Commitments</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2001, China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) under the banner of “market reforms.” The West assumed that China would gradually converge toward transparent, contract-based free market norms. Yet more than two decades later, China retains an extensive state subsidy system and policy-driven resource allocation, using institutional loopholes to secure structural advantages in global trade.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.	The Phrase “Rule of Law”</p>
<ul>
<li>In Western understanding, “rule of law” means restraining government power and protecting individual rights. In the Chinese context, yifa zhiguo (“governing the country according to law”) means using legal instruments to consolidate state authority—the law serves power, not as a check on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Structural Analysis</p>
<p>The key lies in the fact that the Chinese concept of “state” is not equivalent to the Western contractual nation-state. It is a civilizational structure built on centralized authority, stability of order, and hierarchical obedience as its supreme priorities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Power logic over contractual logic: Whether external treaties or domestic laws, ultimate interpretive power always resides with the central authority, not with independent institutions.</li>
<li>Structural adaptability: The civilization can “change skins”—whether under imperial rule, a party-state, or a hybrid economy, the core power–order mechanism remains intact.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consequences of Misjudgment</p>
<p>If the West continues to treat China as merely a “political regime” rather than a “civilizational-structural entity,” the costs will include:</p>
<p>1.	Strategic mismatch: Policies will target specific leaders or parties, ignoring the civilization’s long-term structural continuity.</p>
<p>2.	Institutional vulnerability: In international negotiations, the West will underestimate China’s ability to leverage rules structurally, leading to the gradual reshaping of institutions like the WTO and the UN.</p>
<p>3.	Public misperception: Media narratives will be distracted by short-term events while missing the stable structural drivers behind Chinese behavior.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The “appearance–substance misalignment” is the first major barrier to Western understanding of China. As long as analysis remains stuck in the regime-focused paradigm, the structural core of Chinese civilization will remain invisible. Breaking this barrier requires moving beyond the modern nation-state lens and placing China within the analytical coordinates of a “civilizational-structural entity”—only then can its long-term behavioral patterns be accurately anticipated and effectively countered.</p>
<p>1.2 Value System Misalignment</p>
<p>English Version</p>
<p>Argument Introduction</p>
<p>At the core of Western political philosophy lies the individual—an autonomous rights-bearing entity whose dignity and freedoms are not granted by the state but inherent by birth.</p>
<p>By contrast, Chinese civilization is structured around order and power stability as the primary unit of value. The individual exists not as an autonomous origin of rights but as a functional component of the collective, whose value is defined by its contribution to harmony, hierarchy, and the endurance of centralized authority.</p>
<p>This misalignment in value systems is not a matter of “cultural difference” in the anthropological sense, but a fundamental divergence in the architecture of political morality.</p>
<p>Case Studies</p>
<p>1.	Public Health and Freedom of Movement</p>
<ul>
<li>During the COVID-19 pandemic, many Western countries balanced public health measures with the preservation of individual freedoms. In China, lockdowns were absolute: residents were sealed into their homes, entire cities shut down, and compliance was enforced not as a temporary emergency but as a demonstration of obedience to centralized command.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.	Whistleblowers and Loyalty</p>
<ul>
<li>The case of Dr. Li Wenliang, who warned about the coronavirus outbreak, illustrates the clash. In a Western framework, early warning is a civic duty. In the Chinese framework, speaking outside the officially sanctioned narrative is a breach of loyalty to authority, even if factually correct.</li>
</ul>
<p>Structural Analysis</p>
<p>This divergence originates from two incompatible civilizational axioms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Western axiom: The state exists to serve and protect the individual; legitimate authority is derived from the consent of the governed.</li>
<li>Chinese axiom: The individual exists within the moral-political order; legitimate authority is measured by its ability to maintain stability, not by consent.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result is that concepts such as “freedom,” “rights,” and “law” may share linguistic translations but operate under different structural definitions.</p>
<p>Consequences of Misjudgment</p>
<p>If Western actors fail to grasp this value misalignment, they risk:</p>
<p>1.	Negotiation paralysis: Agreements that rely on shared definitions of “rights” or “freedom” will collapse under incompatible meanings.</p>
<p>2.	Policy backfire: Human rights advocacy framed in individualist terms may strengthen domestic nationalist narratives in China, allowing the state to present Western values as destabilizing forces.</p>
<p>3.	Democratic erosion at home: By adopting Chinese-style “stability-first” frameworks during crises, Western societies risk normalizing collective-subordination logics.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The West’s failure to recognize the primacy of “order and power stability” in Chinese value architecture leads to repeated strategic errors. Unless Western policymakers and civil society recalibrate their analytical frameworks to account for this structural divergence, they will continue to misread China’s motivations and miscalculate its responses—thereby undermining their own democratic resilience.</p>
<p>1.3 The Communication Trap</p>
<p>English Version</p>
<p>Argument Introduction</p>
<p>In the Western context, the fundamental premise of communication is the truthful transmission of information and the coherence of logic. In contrast, the communicative logic of Chinese civilization does not prioritize factual accuracy above all else; instead, it places the preservation of order and the security of authority at its core.</p>
<p>In this system, language is not merely a vehicle for exchanging information — it is a tool for domestication and assimilation. This structural difference often causes Western interlocutors to unconsciously step into a pre-engineered narrative framework, leading to a gradual “boiling frog” effect of intellectual alignment with Chinese priorities.</p>
<p>Case Studies</p>
<p>1.	“With Chinese Characteristics” and Concept Redefinition</p>
<ul>
<li>In international negotiations, China frequently uses terms such as “democracy with Chinese characteristics” or “a socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics.” Western audiences hear “democracy” or “market economy” and instinctively map them to universal definitions, whereas in the Chinese context, these terms have been structurally redefined to mean authority-led arrangements subordinated to order maintenance.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.	Semantic Traps in the Hong Kong Context</p>
<ul>
<li>During controversies over the Hong Kong National Security Law, the Chinese government repeatedly invoked the principle of “upholding the rule of law.” In the West, “rule of law” means the law constrains government power; in China, it means the law is an extension of the government’s will. When Western media quote such statements without clarification, they are inadvertently adopting China’s definition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Structural Interpretation</p>
<p>The mechanism behind these communication traps is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linguistic Structuring: Words are not fixed concepts but “instrumental symbols” whose definitions can be adjusted at will by political authority.</li>
<li>Narrative Framing: All discussions are preconditioned on the primacy of “maintaining stability,” making any argument outside that premise “illegitimate” by default.</li>
<li>Emotional Domestication: By moralizing the narrative (e.g., invoking “patriotism” or “anti-secession”), participants are pressured into self-censorship, emotionally aligning themselves with the authority’s value framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consequences of Misjudgment</p>
<p>If the West continues to overlook such traps, the consequences include:</p>
<p>1.	Semantic Distortion: Dialogue will appear to use the same vocabulary, but in reality, two entirely different systems are communicating, leading to severe policy miscalculations.</p>
<p>2.	Reverse Opinion Shaping: China can exploit Western openness and media infrastructure to export domesticated concepts back into global discourse.</p>
<p>3.	Erosion of Core Concepts: Over time, the Western public’s internal commitment to “democracy,” “rule of law,” and “freedom” will be diluted through prolonged exposure to redefined terms.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The communication trap is not simply a matter of language — it is an external manifestation of civilizational structure. By altering definitions and setting narrative preconditions, it causes opponents to lose value leadership without realizing it. For the West to maintain democratic resilience, it must develop systemic defenses against concept redefinition and narrative manipulation, rather than relying solely on literal interpretation to assess intent.</p>
<h2>Chapter 2｜Blind Spots in the Western Cognitive Framework</h2>
<p>2.1 Linear Misreading of History</p>
<p>English Version</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the dominant Western historical narrative, history is understood as a forward-moving “progress curve” — with liberty, science, and institutional innovation serving as the primary drivers of societal advancement. This linear view of history is rooted in the experience of the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>In contrast, Chinese civilization adheres to a cyclical view of history: dynastic rise and fall, restoration of order, and reconsolidation of power are seen as natural patterns. Stability and continuity take precedence over innovation and transformation. This divergence in temporal logic often leads the West to misread China’s trajectory and outcomes.</p>
<p>Case Studies</p>
<p>1.	Reform and Opening Up Misinterpretation</p>
<ul>
<li>After 1978, China initiated economic reforms. The West widely believed that economic liberalization would naturally lead to political liberalization — a projection based on the experiences of Eastern Europe and parts of Asia. Instead, China experienced rapid economic growth alongside the further centralization of political power, leveraging economic success to tighten social control.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.	“Peaceful Rise” Prediction Gap</p>
<ul>
<li>Western strategists assumed that China’s integration into the international system and access to global trade benefits would gradually lead it to adopt universal rules. However, after joining the WTO, China did not undergo “institutional assimilation.” Instead, it absorbed foreign technology and capital, fortified its domestic power-order structure, and began projecting this model back into global governance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Structural Interpretation</p>
<p>The root cause lies in the different “temporal logics” of civilization:</p>
<ul>
<li>Western Linear Historicism: History is a one-way race toward progress, where each institutional breakthrough is irreversible.</li>
<li>Chinese Cyclical Historicism: History is like the seasons; dynastic changes are merely a change of skin for the power structure, not a fundamental transformation. The primary mission is to maintain order and continuity, not to achieve irreversible institutional change.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the cyclical worldview, “reform” is often defined as a means to restore order, not as an opportunity to dismantle entrenched power structures. This allows Chinese civilization to preserve its core mechanisms under vastly different political forms — whether imperial monarchy, party-state, or hybrid economy, the principles of power concentration and order prioritization remain constant.</p>
<p>Consequences of Misjudgment</p>
<p>If the West continues to apply a linear historical framework to interpret China, it will face three strategic risks:</p>
<p>1.	Strategic Miscalculation: Overestimating the structural impact of short-term reforms while underestimating the resilience of entrenched power mechanisms.</p>
<p>2.	Policy Misalignment: Channeling resources into nurturing “turning points” while ignoring China’s capacity to maintain structural stability behind the façade of institutional change.</p>
<p>3.	Defensive Lag: Failing to anticipate China’s use of economic growth and global engagement to reinforce its internal power mechanisms and promote its cyclical stability model abroad.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The “historical misreading of linearity” causes the West to mistake short-term phenomena for long-term trends, and to confuse surface-level reform with structural transformation. To avoid this cognitive trap, China must be analyzed through the lens of cyclical historicism and civilizational structure, enabling a more accurate assessment of its internal stability mechanisms and its patterns of external expansion.</p>
<p>2.2 The Failure of Institutional Analogy</p>
<p>English Version</p>
<p>Argument Introduction</p>
<p>In international diplomacy, academic research, and media analysis, the Western world often relies on its own institutional references to understand China’s political and legal systems. For instance, seeing the National People’s Congress (NPC) prompts a subconscious comparison to a parliament; reading the Chinese Constitution suggests the assumption that it has supreme legal authority; hearing “rule of law” leads to the belief that the goal is to constrain power and protect citizens.</p>
<p>In reality, China’s institutions are not the product of Western-style “separation of powers + contractual governance.” Instead, they are a hybrid structure blending Confucian ethics, Legalist power techniques, and Daoist flexibility. This hybrid can resemble Western institutions on the surface while operating on a completely different internal logic.</p>
<p>Case Studies</p>
<p>1.	The National People’s Congress and the “Rubber Stamp” Phenomenon</p>
<ul>
<li>Western observers, on first encountering the NPC, might assume it functions as a legislative and oversight body. In the Chinese system, however, the NPC is a subordinate organ within the power hierarchy, primarily tasked with endorsing and transmitting decisions from the supreme power center. Voting results are almost always unanimous, reflecting political conformity rather than pluralistic representation.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.	The Constitution and Power Relations</p>
<ul>
<li>China’s Constitution states that citizens enjoy “freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of procession, and of demonstration.” Yet in practice, constitutional provisions are not directly enforceable in courts. Power can override constitutional principles through lower-level laws, administrative regulations, or political directives—completely reversing the Western principle of constitutional supremacy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Structural Interpretation</p>
<p>The root cause lies in the fact that China’s institutional architecture is designed not to limit power but to organize and reinforce it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Confucian Element: Provides moral legitimacy to authority, maintaining social hierarchy and stability through “ruler–subject” and “parent–child” relational ethics.</li>
<li>Legalist Element: Stresses centralized control and strict discipline, treating law as an instrument of the sovereign (or central power) rather than a restraint upon it.</li>
<li>Daoist Element: Preserves flexibility and ambiguity within the system, enabling adaptation and transformation under external pressure.</li>
</ul>
<p>This “threefold hybrid” mechanism can simulate Western institutions in form, but it will never replicate their checks-and-balances logic. It is a highly adaptive structure capable of wrapping ancient power philosophy in modern terminology, creating the illusion of institutional similarity in international engagement.</p>
<p>Consequences of Misjudgment</p>
<p>If the West continues to use its own institutions as analogies for China’s, it risks:</p>
<p>1.	Policy Misalignment: Placing hope in “institutional reforms” while ignoring that these institutions are merely shells for power instruments, incapable of altering the core structure.</p>
<p>2.	Negotiation Errors: Assuming both sides operate under the same rule-based logic in diplomacy and trade, thereby leaving openings for China to exploit structural gaps to its advantage.</p>
<p>3.	Public Misperception: Allowing media and academia to perpetuate the illusion of “institutional similarity,” which leads to underestimating the long-term civilizational challenge China poses to free societies.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The failure of institutional analogy reveals a critical truth: Similar institutional appearances do not imply identical operational logics. China’s institutions may share names and forms with those in Western democracies, but their civilizational core is a hybrid structure aimed at power concentration and order maintenance. To grasp this, the West must abandon the habit of “structural homology” and instead analyze China’s system from the standpoint of civilizational differences.</p>
<p>2.3 The Clash Between Human Rights and “Renqing”</p>
<p>English Version</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>On the issue of human rights, the conflict between the West and Chinese civilization is not merely a matter of “political stance” or “institutional choice.” It is rooted in fundamentally different civilizational structures.</p>
<p>In the West, the individual right is the basic unit of social operation, protected equally under the law, and defined as an inviolable bottom line.</p>
<p>In Chinese civilization, the basic unit of social operation is the network of relationships and the stability of order. Rights do not exist independently but are embedded in the web of renqing (human sentiment) and guanxi (connections). Within this structure, even when laws and institutions exist, their interpretation and enforcement tend to serve the stability of relational order rather than abstract legal principles.</p>
<p>Cases</p>
<p>1.	Judicial Outcomes Determined by Relationships</p>
<p>Even when the law clearly stipulates the protection of rights, the actual outcome of a case often depends on the parties’ proximity to the centers of power. For example, a local businessman with strong political or social ties can “negotiate” a favorable court ruling through personal connections rather than relying solely on legal provisions. This phenomenon is found not only at the grassroots judicial level but also in cross-border economic disputes.</p>
<p>2.	Labor Rights vs. Social Harmony</p>
<p>When foreign companies in China enforce international labor standards such as formal contracts and overtime limits, local governments may pressure them to “adapt” in the name of preserving employment stability or “social harmony.” In such cases, “stability” takes precedence over “rights,” and companies often have to compromise to survive.</p>
<p>Structural Analysis</p>
<ul>
<li>Primacy of Relationships</li>
</ul>
<p>The Chinese power and social structure is built upon networks of familiarity and hierarchical order. Individual rights in this network are negotiable, not absolute. Legal codes serve as a framework, but the ultimate decision-making power rests at the intersection of authority and relationships.</p>
<ul>
<li>Structural Function of Human Sentiment</li>
</ul>
<p>Renqing is not merely a cultural habit—it functions as a stabilizing mechanism in the civilization’s operating system. Within this logic, strict enforcement of individual rights is seen as “damaging relationships” or even “threatening order.” As a result, institutions naturally lean toward flexibility and ambiguity to preserve space for relational maneuvering.</p>
<p>Consequences of Misjudgment</p>
<p>If the West fails to understand this structural difference and applies its own standard of “human rights” directly to China, the following will occur:</p>
<p>1.	Ineffective Diplomacy and Rights Advocacy</p>
<p>Western initiatives assume that institutional constraints will directly change individual behavior. In the renqing–guanxi system, these constraints will be localized, softened, and ultimately stripped of their binding force.</p>
<p>2.	Moral Compromise in Cross-Border Engagement</p>
<p>International companies or NGOs attempting to enforce human rights standards in China may find that the actual results deviate sharply from the intended goals—and may even be asked to conform to local “relationship management,” leading to ethical concessions.</p>
<p>3.	Backlash in Public Opinion</p>
<p>When Western criticism of China’s human rights record is reframed in Chinese public discourse as “Westerners don’t understand our human-centered society,” it can be interpreted by some as cultural arrogance, thereby weakening the influence of the international human rights narrative.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>On human rights, the Western “rights-first” approach and the Chinese “relationship-first” logic are not simply cultural differences but the clash of two foundational civilizational structures.</p>
<p>Without incorporating the relationship–order logic into the analysis, Western policies and advocacy will struggle to touch the core issue—and may inadvertently be drawn into China’s relational network, losing operational effectiveness.</p>
<p>The key to overcoming this blind spot is to recognize that in the Chinese context, rights are not an untouchable bottom line but an adjustable variable embedded in the power–order network.</p>
<h2>Chapter 3｜Structural Characteristics of Chinese Civilization</h2>
<p>3.1 Core Driver: Order Above All</p>
<p>English Version</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the value hierarchy of Chinese civilization, order has always taken precedence over freedom, equality, and even justice. This prioritization is not only embedded in political institutions but is deeply ingrained in cultural norms, language patterns, and subconscious social behavior. From the perspective of the power center, the ultimate goal of governance is the preservation of social stability and continuity of order—even at the cost of innovation, individual rights, or economic efficiency.</p>
<p>Case Studies</p>
<p>1.	“Stability Over Diversity” Throughout History</p>
<ul>
<li>From the Han Dynasty’s policy of “rejecting all schools of thought but Confucianism,” to the literary inquisitions of the Qing Dynasty, and to the contemporary “stability maintenance” (维稳) system, the pattern is consistent: to preserve order, intellectual diversity and information freedom can be suppressed.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.	Crisis Response Logic</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether facing pandemics, economic crises, or mass incidents, the first response is often information suppression and control measures to prevent public discourse from spiraling, thereby maintaining surface stability rather than fostering transparent cooperation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Structural Interpretation</p>
<ul>
<li>Civilizational Logic: In Chinese civilization, order is regarded as a condition for survival, not merely a tool for governance. This mindset formed in an agrarian society prone to cyclical warfare and has been perpetuated through education and culture.</li>
<li>Power Mechanism: The prioritization of order legitimizes centralized authority—so long as order is preserved, the regime’s legitimacy stands, regardless of economic progress or public welfare.</li>
<li>Social Psychology: The general population subconsciously accepts the notion that “it is better to have stability than freedom,” providing a grassroots foundation for the endurance of centralized rule.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consequences of Misjudgment</p>
<p>If the West fails to grasp this “order above all” driving force, it risks:</p>
<p>1.	Underestimating Resistance to Reform: Even under economic or international pressure, China may delay or avoid systemic reform in the name of stability.</p>
<p>2.	Misreading Foreign Policy: The West may expect economic globalization to lead to liberalization, but China is willing to sacrifice parts of its economic interests to safeguard order.</p>
<p>3.	Policy Backfire: Advocacy for human rights and free speech can be framed domestically as disruptions to order, reinforcing nationalism and a defensive collective mindset.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>“Order above all” is the primary driving force of Chinese civilization. This means that regardless of changes in political form, the structural goal remains the same: to maintain a centralized and controllable society. Recognizing this allows for more accurate long-term strategic predictions, rather than being misled by short-term developments.</p>
<p>3.2 Structural Mechanism: The Six Ministries and the Imperial Core</p>
<p>English Version</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The operational mechanism of power in Chinese civilization has always exhibited an extreme tendency toward centralization. From the Qin-Han era’s Three Lords and Nine Ministers, to the Six Ministries system of the Sui-Tang dynasties, to the contemporary party-state structure, the core logic remains the same: concentrate political, economic, military, and cultural authority into a single vertical chain of command. The system is designed not to disperse power but to ensure that every branch of governance efficiently channels resources and executes orders from the core.</p>
<p>Case Studies</p>
<p>1.	The Six Ministries’ Enduring Logic</p>
<ul>
<li>Established during the Sui and Tang dynasties, the Six Ministries—Personnel, Revenue, Rites, War, Justice, and Works—were not mechanisms of democratic separation of powers, but tools for extending imperial authority. By the Ming and Qing periods, the centralization deepened: no major decision could be enacted without the emperor’s direct approval.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.	Modern Functional Mapping</p>
<ul>
<li>Today’s State Council, Central Military Commission, and Supreme People’s Court may outwardly resemble Western executive, military, and judicial institutions. In reality, all remain under the unified command of the same political core: the Central Committee of the Communist Party. The Six Ministries logic persists in the modern era as “functional departments under total Party control.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Structural Analysis</p>
<ul>
<li>Core Objective: The Six Ministries system and its modern counterparts represent “functional division under centralized command.” Departments have distinct functions, but no institutional independence; all decisions ultimately flow upward to the central authority.</li>
<li>Core-Periphery Relationship: Peripheral departments are accountable not to the public but to the core; the public can only access policy influence indirectly, through the will of the center.</li>
<li>Continuity and Adaptability: Whether under imperial rule, the centralized republic of the early 20th century, or today’s party-state model, the “functional division + centralized authority” structure has remained largely unchanged.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consequences of Misinterpretation</p>
<p>If the West continues to analyze China’s governance through the lens of “separation of powers” or “checks and balances,” several risks emerge:</p>
<p>1.	Unrealistic Reform Expectations: Adding new agencies or ministries will not alter the underlying centralization; so-called “institutional reforms” may leave the core untouched.</p>
<p>2.	Misreading Policy Signals: A statement from a department may be mistaken for policy diversity, when it is in fact a calibrated message from the core.</p>
<p>3.	Increased Cooperation Risks: In international negotiations, Western partners may believe they have secured agreements with a department, only to see them vetoed or reversed by the core authority.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>The Six Ministries system is not merely an ancient administrative framework; it is a deeply ingrained mechanism of centralized power that has persisted for over a thousand years. Its essence lies in making functional divisions serve the will of the core, rather than creating a balanced institutional ecosystem. Recognizing this resilience is essential to understanding why China’s political structure cannot be easily reformed or weakened from within.</p>
<p>3.3 Cultural Tools: Language and “Using Literature to Convey the Way”</p>
<p>English Version</p>
<p>Argument Introduction</p>
<p>In the power structure of Chinese civilization, language and writing are not neutral instruments of communication; they are core cultural weapons for maintaining order, shaping thought, and perpetuating authority. Since the pre-Qin era, the doctrine of wen yi zai dao (“using literature to convey the Way”) has subordinated language to the ruling order — words are not meant to express individual will, but to carry the “Way” as defined by those in power. Through the monopolization of education, canonical interpretation, and official discourse, language becomes the foundational infrastructure of social domestication.</p>
<p>Cases</p>
<p>1.	The Imperial Examination System and Standardized Language</p>
<ul>
<li>From the Sui–Tang period onward, the centralized authority strictly controlled the use of wenyanwen (classical written Chinese) and the interpretation of Confucian classics. Aspiring scholars had to think and write within this linguistic framework to gain access to officialdom. Language thus did more than transmit knowledge — it set cognitive boundaries: only those who could produce the “Eight-Legged Essay” could participate in governance, while others were excluded from the power structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.	Modern Political Terminology and Semantic Engineering</p>
<ul>
<li>Contemporary Chinese political terms such as “rule of law” (yifa zhiguo), “socialism with Chinese characteristics,” and “harmonious society” appear similar to Western concepts but carry entirely different institutional meanings domestically. This double-layer semantic design allows outsiders to believe both sides are discussing the same concept, while internal discourse binds these terms to the logic of centralized authority.</li>
</ul>
<p>Structural Interpretation</p>
<ul>
<li>Language as Order: The unification of language form and the monopoly over official interpretation ensure that discourse operates within controllable boundaries, preventing diverse narratives from challenging legitimacy.</li>
<li>The Formatting Mechanism of Wen: Fixed expression patterns (e.g., Eight-Legged Essays, policy reports, state news templates) limit individual creativity in form, subtly internalizing conformity and obedience.</li>
<li>Narrative Monopoly and Historical Shaping: Through control of discourse, the state dictates the writing of history and the shaping of collective memory, rooting legitimacy in a specific narrative continuously reinforced through education and propaganda.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consequences of Misjudgment</p>
<p>If the West underestimates the institutional role of language and writing in Chinese civilization, it risks:</p>
<p>1.	Dialogue Traps: In international negotiations, being misled by double-layer semantics — believing consensus has been reached while actually entering the other side’s narrative frame.</p>
<p>2.	Public Diplomacy Failure: Values promoted by democratic states may be re-encoded within the Chinese linguistic system, weakening or even reversing their intended meaning.</p>
<p>3.	Accelerated Institutional Penetration: Through cultural exchange and academic cooperation, the Chinese discourse system can seep into Western public space, reshaping the linguistic foundation of public opinion and policy debates.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>In the power architecture of Chinese civilization, language and writing are not merely tools of communication — they are hidden pillars of institutional operation. Through the wen yi zai dao mechanism, thought is molded into a vessel for obedience to order. Only by recognizing the institutional essence of these cultural tools can the West avoid falling into language-driven cognitive traps in engagement, cooperation, or competition.</p>
<p>3.4 Social Ecology: Familism and Emotional Colonization</p>
<p>English Version</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the social ecology of Chinese civilization, the “family” is not merely a network of blood relations; it is a microcosm of power and order. Family-centrism places the value of the individual beneath that of the collective family interest, creating a strong mechanism of obedience through kinship, obligation, and shame. At the same time, emotional colonization—embodied in institutionalized filial piety, hierarchical respect, and the spirit of sacrifice—binds an individual’s emotional energy to existing power structures, making the development of independent personality and public consciousness extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Cases</p>
<p>1.	The Imperial Examination and Family Advancement</p>
<ul>
<li>In imperial China, the civil service examination was not just a personal path to social mobility—it was the decisive means for an entire family to leap in political and economic status. A single successful candidate could elevate the honor and resources of the clan many times over. This system deeply linked family interests to state power, turning the family into a basic unit of regime stability.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.	Modern “Reverse Support” Dynamics</p>
<ul>
<li>In contemporary urban China, young people often rely on parental financial support to purchase housing and marry. Later in life, they bear the burden of their parents’ medical and retirement costs. This high-pressure flow of resources across generations ties both economic and emotional capacities to family obligations, weakening the ability and willingness of individuals to engage in public life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Structural Interpretation</p>
<ul>
<li>The Family as an Extension of Power: The family operates as the foundational governance cell of the state, maintaining order at low cost through blood ties and emotional bonds.</li>
<li>Emotional Conditioning Mechanism: Filial piety, sacrifice, and gratitude are institutionalized to discipline individuals, cloaking obedience to power in the language of “love.”</li>
<li>Intergenerational Control Chain: Parents hold control over economic resources and marital decisions; children bear the responsibility of elderly care and family lineage continuation. This chain not only preserves internal family hierarchy but also provides the state with a stable base of compliance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consequences of Misjudgment</p>
<p>If the West overlooks the institutional role of family-centrism and emotional colonization, it will face:</p>
<p>1.	Misreading of Social Mobilization: Underestimating the role of family in political stability and social control, and mistakenly treating Chinese society as a collection of autonomous individuals.</p>
<p>2.	Policy Transmission Failure: Concepts of democracy and individual rights, when introduced into Chinese society, are re-coded within the framework of family obligations, losing their original emancipatory meaning.</p>
<p>3.	Structural Reform Blockages: Any reform aimed at weakening state power encounters the “soft resistance” of the family system, because family and state exist in a relationship of mutual benefit.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>In Chinese civilization, the family is not merely an emotional community but the grassroots extension of power and order. Emotional colonization makes individuals willingly sacrifice personal freedom for the sake of family and state. This deep binding allows Chinese society to maintain structural stability even under external institutional shocks. Understanding this mechanism is essential to deciphering the resilience of Chinese society and the continuity of its power structures.</p>
<p>3.5 Mode of Expansion: Reverse Unification and External Domestication</p>
<p>English Version</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The expansion model of Chinese civilization is fundamentally different from that of Western colonial powers. Western colonialism relied on military occupation, economic extraction, and institutional transplantation, often imposing control through external force. Chinese civilization, by contrast, excels at a far subtler and longer-lasting approach—reverse unification and external domestication.</p>
<p>“Reverse unification” refers to the process in which, upon contact with external civilizations, China is not assimilated but instead gradually absorbs the other side into its own order system through culture, institutions, language, and interpersonal networks. “External domestication” is the long-term infiltration of values and binding of interests so that external actors unconsciously accept—and even defend—the system.</p>
<p>Cases</p>
<p>1.	The Sinicization of the Mongol Empire</p>
<ul>
<li>After establishing the Yuan dynasty, Mongol nobles initially retained their military superiority and independent nomadic culture. However, in governing China they quickly adopted Chinese language, Confucian rituals, the imperial examination system, and the bureaucratic structure. In less than a century, the Mongol rulers had fully integrated into the framework of Chinese civilization—rather than the other way around.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.	Rule Reconfiguration in Modern International Institutions</p>
<ul>
<li>In platforms such as the United Nations, the Human Rights Council, and the World Health Organization, China does not attempt to overturn existing rules outright. Instead, it gradually shifts their interpretation through personnel appointments, narrative framing, and procedural changes. For example, redefining “human rights” from “individual rights” to “the right to development” undermines the dominance of Western rights discourse in international law.</li>
</ul>
<p>Structural Analysis</p>
<ul>
<li>Cultural–Institutional Dual Adaptation: When engaging with external powers, Chinese civilization often adopts advanced tools or concepts on the surface but transforms them in practice into extensions of its domestic power–order structure.</li>
<li>Narrative Reframing: By controlling the definition of terms and the authority to interpret rules, it alters the meaning of concepts so they serve local interests under a new semantic context.</li>
<li>Interest–Loyalty Binding: Through economic cooperation, political support, and cultural exchange, it creates chains of dependency that cause external actors to objectively defend the operational logic of Chinese civilization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consequences of Misjudgment</p>
<p>If the West continues to underestimate the power of reverse unification and external domestication, it may face:</p>
<p>1.	Gradual Institutional Reconfiguration: International rules quietly drift from their original value foundations toward legitimizing authoritarian structures.</p>
<p>2.	Collapse of Strategic Defenses Against Infiltration: Pro-China factions emerge within democratic societies across economic, academic, media, and cultural spheres, weakening the unity of the democratic camp from within.</p>
<p>3.	Loss of Cultural Immunity: When language and core values are redefined, the public may no longer even realize they have adopted a different civilizational framework.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The outward expansion of Chinese civilization is not a short-term conquest but a long-term structural absorption process. It can alter the institutional and cultural DNA of external systems while maintaining a façade of cooperation and peace. This subtlety and resilience have, throughout history, repeatedly transformed conquerors into defenders of the Chinese system. Understanding and countering this mode of expansion is essential for preserving the structural integrity of free civilizations.</p>
<h2>Chapter 4｜The Five Major Misjudgments of the West in Understanding and Responding to China</h2>
<p>4.1 Overreliance on the Logic of Economic Reciprocity</p>
<p>English Version</p>
<p>Argument Introduction</p>
<p>In the post–Cold War wave of globalization, the West broadly believed that economic reciprocity could lead to political convergence. The underlying assumption was that as trade flows and investment interdependence deepened, both sides would form a “community of shared interests,” reducing the likelihood of conflict and fostering institutional alignment. This logic had worked in certain post–Cold War contexts, such as Eastern Europe and parts of Southeast Asia, and was therefore applied wholesale to China.</p>
<p>Cases</p>
<p>1.	WTO Accession and Investment Optimism (2001–2015)</p>
<p>After China joined the World Trade Organization, Western investment in China surged. Analysts predicted that as China reaped the benefits of global markets, it would gradually adopt transparent institutions and a contract-based economic culture. In reality, China absorbed foreign capital and technology while preserving—and even reinforcing—the Party-state model of economic control, leveraging industrial subsidies, market-access barriers, and state-directed procurement to secure structural advantages.</p>
<p>2.	Diplomatic Overuse of the “Win–Win” Narrative</p>
<p>In initiatives such as the Belt and Road, China frequently deploys the rhetoric of “mutual benefit” to attract partners. In practice, such arrangements often involve debt dependency, control over strategic assets, and political alignment, making “reciprocity” structurally resemble one-way dependency.</p>
<p>Structural Analysis</p>
<p>Within the power–order logic of Chinese civilization, the economy is never an autonomous domain—it is a tool for regime stability and civilizational expansion. “Mutual benefit” does not imply equality in rules or power relations; rather, it assumes that the central authority retains the ability to alter the terms of distribution at will. This stands in direct contrast to the Western market-economy principle that “rules precede power.”</p>
<p>Consequences of Misjudgment</p>
<ul>
<li>Strategic Dependency: Western businesses and governments became overly reliant on China’s supply chains and markets, placing themselves in a weaker bargaining position in key policy disputes.</li>
<li>Institutional Self-Erosion: International trade norms, under constant compromise, gradually shifted toward China’s “flexible enforcement” model, undermining transparency and predictability.</li>
<li>Public Opinion Distortion: Media and business leaders, driven by short-term profit incentives, reinforced the illusion that cooperation inevitably leads to openness—delaying countermeasures against structural penetration.</li>
</ul>
<p>4.2 Overestimating the Feasibility of Institutional Transplantation</p>
<p>English Version</p>
<p>Argument Introduction</p>
<p>Since the end of the Cold War, the West has developed a habitual approach when dealing with transitional states: introduce templates such as constitutions, parliaments, rule of law, and markets, and political as well as social structures will gradually converge toward liberal democracy. This “institutional transplant” logic has seen some success in Eastern Europe, Latin America, and parts of Asia. Consequently, many Western scholars, diplomats, and development agencies have believed that promoting legal reform, encouraging pilot elections, and supporting the growth of civil society would gradually democratize China.</p>
<p>Cases</p>
<p>1.	Legal Aid and Judicial Reform Programs (2000–2010)</p>
<p>Multiple development agencies funded legal education, judge training, and public legal aid centers in China, hoping to promote the principles of judicial independence and procedural justice. However, these resources were quickly absorbed into the state apparatus, and the training outcomes were often used to improve enforcement efficiency rather than to check state power. Independent lawyers and rights advocates became prime targets of surveillance and suppression.</p>
<p>2.	Grassroots Election Experiments (1990s–present)</p>
<p>Village committee elections showed open voting and competition, leading Western observers to believe that China was “nurturing democracy.” In reality, candidate eligibility, voter rolls, and vote-counting procedures were controlled by higher authorities. Elections often served as a tool to legitimize governance rather than a mechanism for devolving power.</p>
<p>Structural Analysis</p>
<p>Within the power–order mechanism of Chinese civilization, institutions are not autonomous rule systems but tools that can be adjusted at will by the power center.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instrumental Nature of Institutions: Regardless of which “modern institution” is introduced, it must be embedded into the pyramid of centralized authority and serve the stability of order.</li>
<li>Power Logic Above Institutional Logic: When institutional provisions conflict with power, power always prevails; rules can be selectively enforced or interpreted to fit political needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that even if China adopts institutional forms similar to the West, their operational outcomes may be entirely different.</p>
<p>Consequences of Misjudgment</p>
<p>1.	Resource Misallocation: Large amounts of external funding and expertise are absorbed by the system without structural reform, inadvertently strengthening the enforcement capacity of existing power mechanisms.</p>
<p>2.	Reform Illusion: The international community mistakenly assumes that China is in a “transitional phase,” thereby delaying essential strategic defenses and institutional safeguards.</p>
<p>3.	Experience Failure: Western “institutional assistance” models that worked elsewhere fail in China, yet new theoretical and policy frameworks for dealing with this reality remain underdeveloped.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>Institutional transplant efforts in China fail not because the technical details of the imported models are flawed, but because the West has ignored the civilization’s structural immunity—its ability to selectively absorb foreign institutional elements and convert them into tools for consolidating power rather than foundations for institutional independence.</p>
<p>4.3 Neglecting the Mechanisms of Language and Thought Control</p>
<p>English Version</p>
<h2>Introduction of the Argument</h2>
<p>In the Western worldview, language is primarily a tool for communication, and the battle of ideas is expected to unfold in an open arena where facts and logic determine the outcome. In the power–order structure of Chinese civilization, however, language is not merely a medium of expression — it is the infrastructure of power itself. It is the core instrument for ideological control, social mobilization, and cultural domestication. Failing to recognize this means that, in dealings with China, the West will be drawn into Beijing’s narrative framework and may unconsciously accept the premises and logic embedded within it.</p>
<p>Case Studies</p>
<p>1.	“Rule of Law” vs. “Yifa Zhiguo”</p>
<p>In official communications, China translates “Rule of Law” as “Yifa Zhiguo” (governing the country according to law), which sounds to Western ears like a commitment to legal governance. In Chinese political practice, however, the phrase means “using law to serve state power,” where the law is a tool for consolidating authority rather than restraining it. By accepting this equivalence, the West often underestimates the depth of the systemic divergence.</p>
<p>2.	“One Country, Two Systems” and Semantic Ambiguity</p>
<p>In the Hong Kong context, “One Country, Two Systems” was understood in the West as a constitutional guarantee — a promise of “fifty years without change.” In Chinese political language, however, “One Country” is the absolute and non-negotiable premise, while “Two Systems” is merely a tactical arrangement, never a recognition of genuine institutional pluralism. This asymmetry in meaning caused the West to lose initiative at critical junctures in diplomacy and public opinion.</p>
<p>Structural Analysis</p>
<p>Within Chinese civilization, language functions as an extension of the power–order structure through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Semantic Sovereignty: Control over the definition of key terms remains in the hands of the central authority, which continuously reinterprets or replaces meanings to ensure that public language serves regime interests.</li>
<li>Narrative Monopoly: Education, media, and cultural production are unified to promote a single historical narrative and value framework, shrinking the space for dissent.</li>
<li>Reverse Concept Export: In international discourse, domestic political terms are repackaged as universally acceptable concepts, exploiting semantic ambiguity for diplomatic and narrative advantage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consequences of Misjudgment</p>
<p>1.	Discursive Passivity: In negotiations and exchanges, the West ends up using Chinese-defined concepts, allowing the scope and focus of discussion to be structurally limited.</p>
<p>2.	Value Dilution: When core Western values (such as the rule of law, freedom, and autonomy) are redefined in translation, the universal understanding of these principles becomes increasingly blurred.</p>
<p>3.	Strategic Misguidance: Underestimating the centrality of language and thought control in China’s governance model leads to policies that neglect the necessity of countering narrative infiltration.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>In engagement with China, language is never neutral. Ignoring its embedded mechanisms of thought control is equivalent to abandoning the first line of cognitive defense. Only by building long-term monitoring and countermeasures against semantic sovereignty, narrative monopoly, and reverse concept export can the West preserve its independence and clarity in both discourse and thought.</p>
<p>4.4 Equating the “China Problem” with Regime Change</p>
<p>English Version</p>
<p>Argument Introduction</p>
<p>In Western political and strategic thinking, changing a country’s political trajectory is often simplified to replacing its ruling party or leadership. This approach has shown some effectiveness in cases like the Soviet Union, Iran, or Iraq—once the top leadership changes, the country’s policies and institutional frameworks may shift dramatically. However, within the “civilization–structure” model of Chinese civilization, regime change does not equate to structural transformation. Even when dynasties fall or parties swap power, the underlying power–order mechanism persists and quickly absorbs the new regime into its existing operational logic.</p>
<p>Case Studies</p>
<p>1.	From Empire to Republic</p>
<p>The 1911 Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing dynasty and established the Republic of China. The West widely expected China to move toward parliamentary politics and constitutional governance. Yet soon after, warlord fragmentation, centralization of authority, and the subordination of legislative bodies to executive power reemerged. Democratic institutions became tools for political struggle, and the core logic of power remained untouched.</p>
<p>2.	From Nationalists to Communists</p>
<p>When the Chinese Communist Party took power in 1949, much of the outside world assumed a complete institutional transformation was underway. In reality, the CCP retained many governance patterns from both the imperial and republican eras—such as centralized authority, political loyalty over professional competence, and tight ideological control.</p>
<p>Structural Analysis</p>
<p>The reason regime change in China rarely leads to structural change lies in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Civilizational Inertia: The deeply embedded model of centralized power, order-first governance, and individual subordination to the collective.</li>
<li>Replaceable Institutional Shells: Whether emperor, president, or party secretary-general, each role can be absorbed into the same power–order mechanism.</li>
<li>Emotional and Cultural Transmission: Clan-based loyalty, examination-style promotion systems, and a language structure built on hierarchical submission naturally carry old power logic into new regimes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consequences of Misjudgment</p>
<p>1.	Policy Misfocus: If the West treats China as a regime problem, it may relax vigilance after a leadership change, only to find that structural issues remain intact.</p>
<p>2.	Strategic Short-sightedness: Overreliance on leadership turnover or democratization expectations overlooks the deeper need for cultural and structural transformation.</p>
<p>3.	Cognitive Misalignment: Public and policymakers become trapped in a cycle of “change–disappointment,” failing to grasp the durability of China’s civilizational structure.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In the context of Chinese civilization, regime change does not mean structural reconstruction. As long as the core power–order mechanism remains intact, any new leadership will be absorbed into it. For the West, the real challenge is not waiting for a “new leader” but learning to recognize and confront this transhistorical, regime-transcending structural continuity.</p>
<p>4.5 Underestimating the Structural Reshaping Power of Chinese Civilization</p>
<p>English Version</p>
<p>Argument Introduction</p>
<p>In most Western perceptions, China’s external influence is primarily understood in terms of economic penetration, market expansion, or propaganda. This overlooks a deeper characteristic of Chinese civilization—it is a self-sustaining structural system with a powerful capacity for “structural replication” and “order reshaping.” It can survive within foreign environments while, over time, gradually modifying the institutions, cultures, and behavioral logics of others to make them compatible with its own structure. This reshaping does not rely on military conquest but is achieved through the slow penetration of culture, language, economic rules, and emotional networks.</p>
<p>Cases</p>
<p>1.	The Spread of Confucianism in East Asia</p>
<p>Historically, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam, while maintaining political independence, deeply absorbed structural elements of Chinese civilization through long-term interaction. These included the imperial examination system, Confucian ethics, and the written script. Such elements reshaped local bureaucratic systems and molded family and societal order.</p>
<p>2.	The Modern Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)</p>
<p>Through infrastructure investments, educational exchanges, and media partnerships, China has promoted its political language, development model, and diplomatic logic in Central Asia, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Many aid-recipient countries, while becoming economically dependent, also begin to display “structural convergence” with the Chinese model—adopting similar public narratives, diplomatic positions, and governance styles.</p>
<p>Structural Analysis</p>
<ul>
<li>Culture–Institution Bundling: When exporting values, Chinese civilization often attaches an entire set of governance tools and linguistic frameworks. Recipients of “technical assistance” or “cultural exchange” are thus tied to a specific power logic.</li>
<li>Gradual Domestication: Unlike Western colonialism, which often involved direct rule, China’s external reshaping operates like chronic infiltration—changing little in the short term but slowly accustoming the other side to a power-first, order-above-all logic.</li>
<li>Structural Compatibility Building: Once a foreign culture incorporates Chinese-compatible mechanisms in education, language, or administration, the independence of its domestic institutions begins to erode.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consequences of Misjudgment</p>
<p>1.	Delayed Defense: Treating China’s influence as mere economic competition blinds the West to cultural and structural changes. By the time institutional reshaping is recognized, it is often too late.</p>
<p>2.	Institutional Dilution: International organizations, trade rules, and academic systems may, through long-term cooperation, absorb elements of the Chinese model, undermining transparency, independence, and checks on power.</p>
<p>3.	Narrative Capture: Both the public and elites may unconsciously adopt China’s framing of issues, drawing democratic societies into debates set on China’s terms.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>To underestimate the structural reshaping power of Chinese civilization is to underestimate its long-term impact on global order. The real challenge is not short-term economic rivalry, but the slow “reverse unification” process at the civilizational level. Only by recognizing its deep mechanisms can the West avoid being quietly absorbed into China’s structural logic.</p>
<h2>Chapter 5｜Building a New Framework for Understanding</h2>
<p>5.1 Civilization Structure Analysis (CSA)</p>
<p>English Version</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In international politics and cross-cultural studies, most analytical tools operate within a “state–institution–policy” framework. This approach works reasonably well when interpreting European, American, or certain Asian societies, where political institutions are tightly coupled with social culture. However, when applied to Chinese civilization, it often fails—because China is not merely a political entity but a civilizational structure spanning millennia, capable of operating under vastly different institutional forms.</p>
<p>The Civilizational Structure Analysis (CSA) approach starts from the premise that a civilization is a self-sustaining system with internal mechanisms, external diffusion patterns, and structural persistence. It focuses not only on the institutional façade but also on the underlying dynamics and logic that allow it to remain stable across time and project influence beyond its borders.</p>
<p>Cases</p>
<p>1.	Late Qing Constitutional Reform and Imperial Residue</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1908, the Qing court announced a plan for “preparatory constitutionalism,” modeling a constitutional monarchy after Japan’s Meiji reforms. Western observers largely believed this would gradually transform China into a constitutional monarchy. Yet within three years, the 1911 Revolution toppled the dynasty, and the new republic inherited the centralized administrative framework of the Qing, with almost no genuine local autonomy or institutional checks. From a CSA perspective, this was not systemic change but a regime-skin swap with the same core power–order structure intact.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.	Reform and Opening-Up and the Reinforcement of the Party-State</p>
<ul>
<li>After 1978, China adopted market-oriented reforms and opened to foreign investment. Many Western analyses, guided by modernization theory, predicted that economic liberalization would naturally lead to political democratization. CSA, however, identifies how the power structure adapted to economic opening—leveraging control over resource distribution and legal mechanisms—to further consolidate central authority and convert economic gains into tools of social control.</li>
</ul>
<p>Structural Interpretation</p>
<p>CSA rests on three methodological pillars:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying Core Drivers: Determining the civilization’s top operational priority (e.g., order over freedom) rather than merely reading surface policy goals.</li>
<li>Tracking Power–Order Mechanisms: Examining whether the underlying distribution of power, order maintenance, and social mobilization changes when institutions or policies shift.</li>
<li>Assessing Structural Continuity: Measuring a civilization’s ability to preserve its core mechanisms through external shocks and internal reforms, and using this to forecast its long-term trajectory.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Chinese case, CSA consistently reveals a pattern: regardless of the political façade—imperial monarchy, party-state system, or hybrid economy—the core is a highly adaptive, centralized power structure that absorbs foreign elements and reconfigures them to operate within its own order logic.</p>
<p>Consequences of Misinterpretation</p>
<p>If the West continues to substitute institutional-form analysis for CSA, several outcomes are likely:</p>
<p>1.	Underestimating Structural Resilience: Mistaking short-term political or economic shifts for systemic transformation, overlooking the endurance of old mechanisms beneath new veneers.</p>
<p>2.	Policy Misalignment: Targeting China’s institutional forms (e.g., elections, market access) rather than its core power–order structure, leading to pressure and negotiations with limited long-term effect.</p>
<p>3.	Defensive Blind Spots: Designing international rules without accounting for China’s structural adaptability, enabling gradual remolding of those rules to fit its internal logic.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Civilizational Structure Analysis offers a framework that moves beyond the modern nation-state paradigm. Only by understanding the core drivers, power mechanisms, and structural continuity of Chinese civilization can the West avoid strategic misjudgments in policy and cooperation. This approach applies not only to China but also to other long-duration civilizations such as India and the Islamic world, where institutional forms often mask deep structural constants.</p>
<p>5.2 Civilization Immune System Model (CIS)</p>
<p>English Version</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In biology, the immune system’s role is to detect, resist, and eliminate pathogens that threaten the organism’s stability. Likewise, a civilization—understood as a complex social organism—requires a mechanism to identify, resist, and repair structural threats. This is the core logic of the Civilization Immunity System (CIS).</p>
<p>In mainstream Western political and international relations analysis, security is often framed in terms of military power, economic sanctions, or legal frameworks, while the “immune function” of a civilization is largely overlooked. CIS emphasizes that a civilization can only achieve long-term stability and health when it can effectively recognize both external invasions and internal malignancies, and address them without compromising its own healthy structures.</p>
<p>Case Studies</p>
<p>1.	Post-WWII Western Europe and Institutional Immunity</p>
<ul>
<li>After WWII, Western European nations rebuilt not only their economies but also a multi-layered institutional immune system. NATO acted as a military shield against Soviet expansion, while the European Union created unified economic and legal frameworks to prevent members from sliding into authoritarianism for short-term political gain. This “institutional immunity” safeguarded against both external threats and the internal revival of fascism.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.	Structural Immune Deficiency in an East Asian Power</p>
<ul>
<li>An East Asian major power experienced rapid economic growth but lacked a genuine structural immune system. Cultural imports from abroad often reinforced, rather than weakened, its domestic power structure. It showed no real capacity to self-repair corruption, power concentration, or systemic decay. Instead, international engagement strengthened its internal control mechanisms, upgrading the tools of centralized authority.</li>
</ul>
<p>Structural Analysis</p>
<p>The CIS framework focuses on three core elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detection – Can the civilization identify internal or external factors that threaten its structural stability, such as power monopolies, cultural infiltration, or institutional hollowing?</li>
<li>Defense – Are there effective mechanisms to contain such threats, including legal checks and balances, public oversight, and cross-civilization cooperation?</li>
<li>Recovery – When structural damage occurs, can the civilization restore its health without sacrificing its core values, as postwar Germany did by rebuilding democracy rather than reverting to authoritarian structures?</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Chinese context, CIS exposes a critical flaw: its “immune response” tends to target ideological diversity and institutional checks imported from abroad, while failing to address the malignancy of internal power concentration—often treating it as the very source of order and stability.</p>
<p>Consequences of Misjudgment</p>
<p>If the outside world engages China without a CIS perspective, it risks:</p>
<p>1.	Misplaced Defense – Overestimating the impact of external pressure on internal change, while underestimating the instinct to protect structural pathologies.</p>
<p>2.	Passive Assimilation – Allowing rules and norms in exchanges to be gradually reshaped to fit the logic of China’s power structure.</p>
<p>3.	Immunity Collapse – Failing to detect and resist the infiltration of the Chinese model, leading to the quiet restructuring of one’s own civilization from within.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The Civilization Immunity System is more than an analytical model—it is an early-warning mechanism. It reminds us that the health of a civilization depends not only on economic strength or military capability but also on its capacity to prevent internal cancerization and resist external structural encroachment. In addressing China, CIS offers a framework that moves beyond economics and politics, enabling the West to avoid strategic errors rooted in structural blind spots.</p>
<p>5.3 Linguistic and Narrative Detoxification Methods</p>
<p>English Version</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In any civilizational structure, language is not merely a tool for communication—it is an instrument for shaping cognition and legitimizing power. The structure of language and the framing of narratives determine whether people can grasp certain concepts, question existing orders, or even imagine alternative social systems.</p>
<p>Over the course of its history, Chinese civilization has developed a highly sophisticated “language–thought control mechanism”, embedding the logic of power deep into everyday speech and cultural storytelling. This mechanism is not just about overt censorship; it operates by normalizing certain expressions and institutionalizing narrative patterns so that the ruled unconsciously accept—and even reproduce—the worldview of the rulers.</p>
<p>To truly understand and resist such structural influence, one must engage in language and narrative detoxification: stripping away the hidden power directives embedded in words, reconstructing the boundaries of discourse, and restoring communication to a state of equality, truth, and openness.</p>
<p>Case Studies</p>
<p>1.	The “Stability Above All” Trap</p>
<ul>
<li>In the Chinese political lexicon, “stability” is framed as the supreme priority of all policies and actions—placed even above the rule of law and human rights. On the surface, this sounds reasonable. In practice, however, “stability” often becomes a legitimizing pretext for suppressing dissent and perpetuating centralized power.</li>
<li>In international dialogues, this narrative is translated into “development first,” making it harder for outsiders to directly challenge it, and subtly pushing them into a value framework that prioritizes order and power concentration.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.	The “Big Family” Metaphor and Political Obedience</p>
<ul>
<li>In Chinese discourse, the state is often portrayed as a “big family,” with leaders described as “parent officials” and citizens as “children.” This narrative embeds hierarchical, unconditional obedience into the political culture, granting political authority emotional legitimacy.</li>
<li>When exported into international cooperation contexts, this framing erodes the logic of equality between actors and replaces it with a patron–gratitude relationship model, where reciprocity is replaced by loyalty and deference.</li>
</ul>
<p>Structural Analysis</p>
<p>The core steps of language and narrative detoxification include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying toxic elements: Detect hidden power cues, cognitive frames, or emotional manipulation embedded in phrases like “for the greater good” or “don’t cause trouble for the country.”</li>
<li>Restoring factual meaning: Deconstruct narratives back to their factual and logical foundations, removing moral blackmail and emotionally charged rhetoric.</li>
<li>Reconstructing expression: Replace vague, closed terms with precise, open language, and institutionalize the legitimacy of multiple narratives in the public sphere.</li>
</ul>
<p>Within the Chinese power structure, language functions as an extension of the system, and narrative as the firewall of order. If the outside world fails to identify and detoxify this “soft structural weapon,” it risks being passively drawn into the other side’s value framework during communication.</p>
<p>Consequences and Risks</p>
<p>Failure to detoxify language and narrative can lead to:</p>
<p>1.	Cognitive assimilation: Unconsciously accepting the other side’s value hierarchy and definitions of problems.</p>
<p>2.	Policy distortion: Allowing embedded narratives to influence the formulation of China-related strategies.</p>
<p>3.	Institutional infiltration: Over time, adopting a language pattern infused with power logic can reshape domestic political culture and social norms.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Language and narrative detoxification is not only a defensive measure—it is a form of cognitive rehabilitation. In cross-civilizational exchanges, one must pay attention not only to what is being said, but also to how it is said, and why it is framed that way. Only by stripping away the hidden power structures embedded in language and narratives can we avoid having our thought systems reshaped at a structural level, and engage in cooperation and competition on a truly equal cognitive footing.</p>
<p>5.4 Cultural Structural Infiltration Risk Assessment System</p>
<p>2.	制度兼容性（Institutional Compatibility）</p>
<p>4.	扩散能力（Diffusion Capability）</p>
<p>English Version</p>
<h2>Introduction of the Argument</h2>
<p>In the context of globalization, cultural exchange is often celebrated as a bridge for mutual understanding and cooperation. However, when the culture in question carries a highly stable and self-replicating power–order structure, such “exchange” can evolve into structural infiltration.</p>
<p>The spread of Chinese civilization abroad is not merely about cuisine, calligraphy, or festive celebrations—it comes with an entire set of value logics, linguistic codes, and operational mechanisms for society. Once such structures enter free societies, they can subtly reshape institutional habits and social ecosystems. Therefore, building a Cultural Structural Infiltration Risk Assessment System is an essential step for democracies to safeguard their institutional immunity.</p>
<p>Case Studies</p>
<p>Case 1: Overseas Chinese Language Education and Cultural Centers</p>
<ul>
<li>In many Western countries, Confucius Institutes and various Chinese-language schools not only teach the language but also embed specific historical narratives and value judgments. For example, textbooks may deliberately downplay political repression or contentious historical events, replacing “freedom” and “rights” with “stability” and “development” as societal ideals.</li>
<li>The long-term effect on second-generation immigrants is the cultivation of cultural adaptability to authoritarianism. Even while living under democratic systems, they may instinctively accept hierarchical order and concentrated power.</li>
</ul>
<p>Case 2: Business Cooperation and Standard Setting</p>
<ul>
<li>In emerging sectors such as 5G and artificial intelligence, Chinese companies not only export products but also shape global standards and technical protocols, embedding their operational logic into international markets.</li>
<li>These standards are not mere technical parameters—they carry structural assumptions about data, privacy, and governance. For instance, centralized data management is framed as a mark of “efficiency” rather than a source of “risk.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Structural Analysis</p>
<p>The risk of cultural structural infiltration does not lie in the cultural elements themselves, but in whether these elements carry structural genes that conflict with the institutional logic of free societies.</p>
<p>A sound risk assessment should include four key dimensions:</p>
<p>1.	Value Penetration</p>
<ul>
<li>Measures the extent to which cultural imports guide the public toward accepting value logics incompatible with domestic institutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.	Institutional Compatibility</p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluates how the underlying social operating model of the culture aligns—or clashes—with domestic institutional principles such as checks and balances, individual rights, and the rule of law.</li>
</ul>
<p>3.	Narrative Binding</p>
<ul>
<li>Examines whether the cultural input binds audiences to specific historical interpretations or political positions through language, stories, and symbols.</li>
</ul>
<p>4.	Diffusion Capability</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyzes the speed, coverage, and self-replicating potential of the cultural element within the target society.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consequences of Misjudgment</p>
<p>Failing to systematically assess cultural structural infiltration exposes Western societies to:</p>
<p>1.	Institutional Softening – The democratic system is eroded “boiling frog” style, gradually losing the public will to resist concentrated power.</p>
<p>2.	Narrative Replacement – Public discourse becomes embedded with non-native historical and value narratives, causing societal division and policy volatility.</p>
<p>3.	Structural Dependence – Economic, technological, and educational systems become reliant on external structural logic, making disengagement extremely costly.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Cultural exchange should be based on equality and mutual respect. But when such exchange carries a self-replicating power–order structure that conflicts with free institutions, it demands a scientific system for risk identification and defense. The Cultural Structural Infiltration Risk Assessment System is not about rejecting cultural exchange; it is about ensuring that while absorbing foreign cultures, societies do not lose the core immunity of their own institutions.</p>
<h2>Chapter 6｜Recommendations and Action Pathways</h2>
<p>6.1 Think Tanks and Academia: Promote Structural Research and Avoid Surface-Level Descriptions</p>
<p>English Version</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>When engaging with Chinese civilization, Western think tanks and academia have often relied on conventional frameworks from political science, international relations, and economics. These frameworks—rooted in Western historical experience—tend to emphasize institutional evolution, economic interdependence, and international norms. However, the operational logic of Chinese civilization is not merely about institutional competition or ideological rivalry; it is an internally sustained, cross-dynastic structural power mechanism.</p>
<p>If academic and policy research remains at the level of surface descriptions—focusing on “reform,” “modernization,” or “diplomatic shifts”—it will fail to reveal the enduring structural core and, more critically, will be unable to anticipate its modes of external expansion.</p>
<p>Cases</p>
<p>1.	Overprediction of Political Transition After the Cold War</p>
<ul>
<li>In the 1990s, many Western scholars projected that China would follow the path of “economic liberalization → growth of the middle class → political democratization,” modeled on transitions in Eastern Europe, South America, and parts of East Asia. In reality, economic openness coincided with the consolidation of centralized power and tighter information control, producing a governance structure more resilient than during the Cold War.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.	Fragmented Studies on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)</p>
<ul>
<li>A large body of academic and policy literature interpreted the BRI as an economic cooperation plan, an infrastructure investment network, or a geopolitical project, but overlooked its civilizational dimension: it not only exports capital and technology but also projects a governance template centered on order-first priorities, centralized authority, and narrative control. This analytical gap has led to policy recommendations that consistently underestimate its structural impact.</li>
</ul>
<p>Structural Interpretation</p>
<p>The essence of Chinese civilization lies not in its formal institutions, but in the structural principles behind them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Order Before Change: Any reform is conditional on preserving the core order, not advancing irreversible institutional transformation.</li>
<li>Stability of the Power Core: Whether under imperial rule, hybrid warlord regimes, or party-state governance, the organizational logic of the power network remains largely unchanged.</li>
<li>Embedded Narrative and Cultural Tools: Language, historical narratives, ritual systems, and interpersonal obligations fuse institutional forms with cultural identity, granting them cross-generational resilience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without incorporating these structural factors, academic and policy analysis will repeatedly fall into the cycle of misread → correction → misread again.</p>
<p>Consequences / Risks</p>
<p>If think tanks and academia continue to rely on surface-level analysis, they face three strategic risks:</p>
<p>1.	Distorted Forecasting: Overestimating the long-term impact of short-term political or economic events while underestimating the restorative force of structural inertia.</p>
<p>2.	Policy Ineffectiveness: Crafting China strategies on flawed premises, resulting in misplaced investments and defensive priorities.</p>
<p>3.	Loss of Discourse Leadership: In the global knowledge market, Western scholarship risks being overtaken by research communities that understand—and even exploit—the structural logic of Chinese civilization.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>To truly understand and respond to China’s external behavior, think tanks and academia must shift from “surface research” to “structural analysis”—developing methodologies capable of identifying the triad of order logic, power networks, and cultural instruments. This is not only a scholarly upgrade but also a prerequisite for effective policy defense and civilizational immunity.</p>
<p>6.2 Policymakers: Establish Long-Term Cultural Immunity Strategies Instead of Short-Term Diplomatic Games</p>
<p>English Version</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>When dealing with China, many Western policymakers still rely on short-term diplomatic games—attempting to alter China’s behavior through negotiations, sanctions, cooperative agreements, or targeted diplomatic events. The underlying assumption is that China’s strategic choices will shift sustainably in response to external pressure or incentive.</p>
<p>However, the structural inertia of Chinese civilization means that short-term diplomatic measures alone cannot disrupt its underlying operating logic. On the contrary, China often uses the cycles of diplomacy and agenda-setting to transform external pressure into a tool for internal consolidation, while steadily advancing its own narratives and norms in the international arena.</p>
<p>Case Studies</p>
<p>1.	The “Time Dissipation” Strategy in Trade Negotiations</p>
<ul>
<li>During the U.S.–China trade dispute, the United States sought to apply pressure through tariffs and fixed negotiation deadlines. China countered by prolonging the talks, making selective concessions, and strengthening domestic propaganda—turning external pressure into a rallying point for national unity. At the same time, it accelerated supply chain localization, reducing the long-term impact of external sanctions.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.	Climate Cooperation and Narrative Reframing</p>
<ul>
<li>In climate diplomacy, Western actors hoped to guide China toward greater emission reduction commitments through cooperative frameworks. While accepting external funding and technology, China reframed the climate agenda within its “right to development” narrative, positioning itself as both an environmental participant and the representative of developing countries—thus securing more strategic leeway in global negotiations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Structural Interpretation</p>
<p>From a civilizational-structural perspective, China’s external strategy is not reactive but follows a three-phase dynamic of absorption → transformation → reverse projection:</p>
<ul>
<li>Absorption: Acquiring external resources, technologies, and global attention on key issues.</li>
<li>Transformation: Embedding these external inputs into domestic order and narrative systems so that they serve the internal power structure.</li>
<li>Reverse Projection: Exporting the modified narratives and frameworks back into the international system, shaping external perceptions and institutional environments.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, if policymakers equate the “China problem” with a matter of diplomatic bargaining or regime pressure alone, they overlook its deeper civilizational immunity—its capacity to self-repair under external stress and to influence the external environment in return.</p>
<p>Risks of the Short-Term Approach</p>
<p>Persisting in short-term diplomatic thinking carries several dangers:</p>
<p>1.	Strategic Miscalculation: Overestimating the lasting impact of a single round of sanctions or negotiations while underestimating China’s ability to restore its institutional and narrative position.</p>
<p>2.	Issue Reversal: Diplomatic pressure points may be reframed by China into rallying narratives for domestic cohesion and international sympathy.</p>
<p>3.	Defensive Lag: Failing to establish mechanisms against long-term structural penetration, allowing external defenses to be gradually eroded.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>To engage with China effectively, policymakers must move beyond episodic diplomacy and toward a long-term cultural immunity strategy. This means building defenses not only in economic, technological, and security spheres but also in the realms of language, narrative, and institutional design. Diplomacy should be seen not merely as event management, but as a structural resistance project—one capable of sustaining strategic stability and cognitive advantage over the long term.</p>
<p>6.3 Media and Public: Identify and Resist Structural Narrative Infiltration</p>
<p>English Version</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In today’s globalized information environment, China’s strategy extends beyond economics, diplomacy, and technology into the realm of narratives and perception management. This form of infiltration differs from traditional propaganda—it rarely comes in the form of blunt political slogans. Instead, it embeds itself in culture, commerce, entertainment, and academic exchanges, gradually shaping how foreign audiences perceive China.</p>
<p>For media and the public, lacking the ability to identify such structural narrative infiltration means passively absorbing a China-centric narrative—filtered, rewritten, and optimized for political objectives—until it subtly influences public opinion, policy stances, and even cultural identity.</p>
<p>Case Studies</p>
<p>1.	“Invisible Editing” in Entertainment and Cultural Products</p>
<ul>
<li>In Hollywood films, international sports events, and global pop culture, content related to China is often “preemptively self-censored” to avoid politically sensitive topics, securing access to the Chinese market. As a result, global audiences see a version of China that has been intentionally edited and softened—shaping perceptions over time in ways favorable to the Chinese state.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.	Conditional Academic and Think Tank Partnerships</p>
<ul>
<li>In international academic exchanges, China sometimes leverages funding or joint projects to influence research topics and outcomes. Some agreements subtly restrict discussion of certain political subjects, ensuring that while research appears academically neutral, it avoids confronting key structural issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Structural Analysis</p>
<p>From a civilization-structure perspective, this narrative infiltration operates through a “frame-shaping to cognitive-freezing” mechanism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frame-Shaping: Using cultural, economic, or academic channels to establish an interpretive framework favorable to China—often without the audience realizing they have accepted these premises.</li>
<li>Cognitive-Freezing: When such frameworks are repeatedly reinforced through media, entertainment, education, and expert commentary, they harden into “common sense,” marginalizing or delegitimizing critical voices.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this model, infiltration does not rely on high-intensity propaganda. Instead, it works through long-term, low-intensity, cross-domain content delivery—gradually acclimating external societies to a worldview aligned with the Chinese structural order.</p>
<p>Risks and Consequences</p>
<p>If media and the public fail to recognize and resist such infiltration, three key risks emerge:</p>
<p>1.	Opinion Drift: Public discourse gradually shifts toward positions favorable to China.</p>
<p>2.	Policy Softening: As public perception is reshaped, political pressure on policymakers to take a firm stance weakens.</p>
<p>3.	Cultural Misjudgment: External societies may overestimate China’s openness and compatibility with democratic systems, while underestimating its inherent prioritization of order and centralized authority.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>When dealing with China, media and the public must understand that narrative warfare and infiltration are structural rather than episodic phenomena. The key issue is not merely whether information is true or false, but who sets the terms of the conversation. Building narrative detoxification mechanisms, improving infiltration detection capabilities, and fostering long-term cognitive immunity in culture, education, and public discourse are essential to maintaining independent judgment and democratic resilience.</p>
<p>6.4 International Cooperation: Build a Global Civilization Immunity Alliance</p>
<p>English Version</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>When facing the structural expansion and adaptive assimilation of Chinese civilization on a global scale, no single country or region can effectively respond alone. This is not only because the channels of infiltration are diverse—spanning economy, culture, technology, and diplomacy—but also because the model possesses cross-system, cross-cultural, and cross-regional adaptability. In other words, even countries with vastly different political systems can exhibit similar patterns of structural assimilation under shared pressures.</p>
<p>For this reason, establishing a Global Civilization Immunity Alliance is not merely a geopolitical choice; it is a necessity for the survival of diverse civilizations. The aim is not to confront China as a nation-state, but rather to defend against the outward expansion and colonial mechanisms of a structural civilization, thereby preserving a pluralistic, free, and healthy global civilizational ecosystem.</p>
<p>Case Studies</p>
<p>1.	Institutional Safeguards in Cross-Border Technology Cooperation</p>
<ul>
<li>In fields such as 5G, artificial intelligence, and critical infrastructure, some states have found that Chinese technological standards and data governance rules already embed structural control mechanisms. While unilateral refusal may be costly, an alliance can collectively enforce security standards, reducing the risk of being “structurally bound” through technical dependence.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.	Mutual Recognition and Protection in Cultural and Educational Exchanges</p>
<ul>
<li>In cases involving Confucius Institutes and certain cross-border cultural programs, nations have observed that “cooperation” sometimes comes with content censorship and narrative filtering. By establishing transparent review processes and shared curriculum recognition standards, an alliance can prevent such exchanges from becoming one-way channels for narrative infiltration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Structural Analysis</p>
<p>From a civilizational-structure perspective, the Global Civilization Immunity Alliance would serve three key functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information and Pattern Sharing: Member states share infiltration cases, structural analysis models, and defense strategies, enabling rapid detection of “structural signals.”</li>
<li>Institutional and Regulatory Coordination: Alliance members can establish unified “civilization immunity clauses” in trade, technology, and cultural agreements to prevent being picked off one by one.</li>
<li>Co-Narrative Construction: By actively promoting pluralistic and free civilizational narratives in global discourse, the alliance can weaken the discursive dominance of structural civilizations in international arenas.</li>
</ul>
<p>This alliance would not depend on ideological homogeneity, but rather on structural security consensus—the shared recognition that the expansion mechanisms of any civilization must be constrained to preserve global civilizational diversity.</p>
<p>Potential Risks if Absent</p>
<p>Without such a cooperative mechanism, the global community faces three major risks:</p>
<p>1.	Divide and Conquer: States under economic or diplomatic pressure may make individual compromises, undermining collective resilience.</p>
<p>2.	Structural Imbalance: The unchecked global spread of a single civilization’s structural mechanisms could reshape international rules, degrading a diverse world into a uniform order.</p>
<p>3.	Immunity Vacuum: Without cross-border information exchange, structural infiltration cases may be detected too late, missing critical response windows.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The establishment of a Global Civilization Immunity Alliance is not a Cold War-style bloc confrontation but a global public safety mechanism. Its central purpose is to ensure that the expansion of any civilization is subject to structural scrutiny and rule-based constraints, preventing unconscious global assimilation. Only when such cooperation becomes the norm can humanity maintain a diverse, balanced, and mutually respectful civilizational ecosystem.</p>
<p>Conclusion｜The Last Line of Freedom</p>
<p>English Version</p>
<p>In the tide of globalization, Chinese civilization is not merely a regional historical legacy—it is a resilient, transhistorical structural force. Its mode of influence does not rely solely on military power or economic expansion, but on the deep embedding of language, culture, institutions, and emotional frameworks, enabling the silent reconstruction of the outside world. In its logic, stability outweighs freedom, order takes precedence over innovation, and the existence of the individual must serve the continuity of the structure.</p>
<p>To understand the true nature of this civilization is not to incite hostility or to create another civilizational confrontation, but to ensure that humanity does not lose the foundations of freedom in the slow, structural domestication of the future. Freedom is never a gift from history—it survives only through structural protection, institutional defense, and collective vigilance.</p>
<p>The challenge today is not only to defend against this structural domestication at the level of law and governance, but also to maintain immunity in our thought, culture, narratives, and daily life. We must recognize that any civilization, once stripped of its immunity, can domesticate itself into decline—and globalization amplifies this risk exponentially.</p>
<p>If we fail to identify and respond to such structural forces, the future of civilization will not be lost on the battlefield, but rewritten—softly, irreversibly—under the banners of “cooperation,” “exchange,” and “mutual benefit.”</p>
<p>The last line of defense for human civilization is not a border on a map, but the boundary we draw in our minds between ourselves and the structure—one that determines whether we can still walk toward the future in the name of freedom.</p>
