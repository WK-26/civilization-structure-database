1. Core Objectives
- Safeguard Europe’s core civilizational values of love and freedom.
- Identify and admit high-CHS (high Civilization Health Score) individuals, while restricting the spread of high-negative CHS (structurally cancerous) individuals.
- Combine individual freedom of movement with a civilization-level immune system to prevent structural contamination.

---

2. Core Principles
1. Function First Principle
   - Prioritize admission of individuals with high FFI (Functional Fabric Index) and high CHS as “functional cells” for the civilization.
2. Structural Risk Defense Principle
   - Apply entry quarantine or outright denial for individuals with high CSI (Cancerous Structure Index) and high-negative CHS.
3. Convertibility Principle
   - Offer cultural integration and civilizational adaptation programs for individuals with neutral or slightly negative CHS.
4. Long-Term Tracking Principle
   - Implement continuous CHS monitoring post-entry to prevent low-CHS groups from forming reverse-unification structures in Europe.

3. Operational Model
3.1 Pre-entry Screening
- Use the CHS model to quantify refugees:
  - FFI (Functional Fabric Index)
  - CSI (Cancerous Structure Index)
  - CHS (Net Civilizational Health Score)
- Conduct scoring via interviews, background checks, social media analysis, and AI-based semantic evaluation.

3.2 Classification & Diversion

3.3 Integration & Immunity
- High CHS → Assign to key sectors and community leadership roles.
- Medium CHS → Provide intensive language, law, and cooperation culture training.
- Low CHS → Pair with “civilization mentors” (high-CHS individuals) to prevent isolated cultural enclaves.

3.4 Dynamic Evaluation
- Reassess CHS every 1–2 years to adjust residency status.
- For individuals with significant CHS decline and structural risks, limit their societal influence.

---

4. Crisis Response Mechanisms
1. Structural Contamination Quarantine
   - If high-negative CHS groups form reverse-unification structures, dismantle and disperse them, or deport core actors.
2. Civilization Immunity Education
   - Promote civilizational core values and immune awareness in schools and local communities for all new arrivals.
3. International Cooperation
   - Share CHS databases with other free civilizational states to build a global civilization immune network.

---

5. Final Goal
- Shift refugee policy from “passive reception” to “precision civilizational enhancement + risk isolation”.
- Build the world’s first Civilizational Immune Migration Management System, ensuring Europe’s free structures remain sustainable.

Framework in Three Stages
1. Front-End Screening: CHS Filtering Before Entry
- Functional Identification – Assess FFI & CSI via education, behavior, social media, language, political attitudes.
- Structural Immunity Threshold – Ensure entrants have CSI ≤ 4.0.
- Regional Diversion – High-CHS to core society; low-CHS to transition/adaptation zones.

2. Mid-Term Transformation: The “Metabolic” Function
- Cultural Absorption & Structural Reshaping – Integrate into European legal/values system.
- Lifestyle Map Upgrade – Guide toward high-CHS living environments.
- Language & Narrative Training – Build capacity for public discourse.

3. Long-Term Defense: Immunity & Reverse-Unification Prevention
- Dynamic Check-ups – Reassess CHS every 2–3 years.
- Prevent Reverse Unification – Stop structural enclaves.
- Global Cooperation – Share CHS database with other states.

Expected Outcomes:
- Europe keeps high-CHS core.
- High-CHS refugees integrate faster.
- Low-CHS individuals have a safe transformation path.

Appendix A: CHS Classification Standards (–10 ~ +10)
- FFI > CSI → Positive CHS → Net positive contribution.
- FFI ≈ CSI → CHS ~ 0 → Structurally neutral, environment-dependent.
- CSI > FFI → Negative CHS → Erodes civilizational structures.
- Large |CHS| → Stable role (positive = contributor; negative = eroder; near zero = unstable).

Application to Refugee Screening:
- Direct Acceptance – CHS ≥ +3
- Conditional Acceptance + Transformation Program – CHS 0 ~ +2
- High-Risk Observation or Rejection – CHS ≤ –1
