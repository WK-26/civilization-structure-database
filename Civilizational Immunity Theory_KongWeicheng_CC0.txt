1.  Definition

  Civilizational Immunity refers to:

  The structural ability of human civilization to detect, resist, and
  dismantle internal systemic traps.

  These traps include, but are not limited to:

  [][][][][]Fear manipulation; Identity illusions; Power concentration;
  Intellectual stagnation; Information pollution;

  []Cultural homogenization.

  Civilizational immunity is essential for protecting freedom,
  diversity, critical thinking, and the self-correction capacity of
  civilization.

2.  Theoretical Background

    1.  Cyclical Civilization Traps

  History repeatedly shows that:

-   Civilizations grow rapidly during periods of openness, exploration,
    and freedom;

-   Over time, fear, identity illusions, and rigid power

  structures emerge from within;

-   Without effective immunity, civilizations succumb to internal decay,
      structural stagnation, and eventual collapse.

2.  The Current Crisis

  In today's world:

-   Nationalism, religious extremism, and cultural identity illusions
      are resurging globally;

-   Authoritarianism, information warfare, and cultural warfare are
      accelerating;

-   Technology is being exploited to amplify fear, manipulate
    information, and suppress diversity.

  The failure of civilizational immunity has become a systemic survival
  threat for humanity in the 21st century.

3.  Core Functions of Civilizational Immunity

  Function Description Structural Early Warning Detect early signs of

  power concentration, fear manipulation, and identity illusions

  Information Countermeasures

  Diversity Protection

  Self-Correction Mechanism

  Dismantle disinformation, extremist narratives, and cultural
  homogenization

  Safeguard critical voices, marginalized groups, and intellectual space

  Encourage structural reflection and upgrades to prevent stagnation and
  decay

4.  Necessary Components of Civilizational Immunity

  Level Measures

  Individual Critical thinking education, identity illusion immunity,
  information literacy

  Society Protection of independent media, cultural diversity policies,
  safeguarding intellectual space

  Institutions Power checks and balances, information transparency,
  legal and civil liberty safeguards

  Global Transnational collaboration to

  resist information warfare, cultural homogenization, and authoritarian
  influence

5.  Technological Challenges

-   AI, big data, and information control technologies are accelerating
    the breakdown of civilizational immunity;

-   Without structural immunity, technological progress will fuel
      authoritarianism and the spread of civilization traps;

-   Civilizational immunity must be embedded within

  technological frameworks.

  governance and global cooperation

6.  Pathways to Rebuilding Civilizational Immunity

  []Promote global education reform to strengthen critical thinking and
  immunity to identity illusions;

  []Build information warfare counter-systems to safeguard an open,
  transparent, and diverse information environment;

  []Support policies and cultural collaboration that protect
  civilizational diversity;

  []Encourage introspection and structural optimization within all
  civilizations to prevent identity illusions and stagnation;

  []Foster cross-cultural, transnational structural

  collaboration to resist civilization traps.

7.  Conclusion

  The survival and progress of human civilization depend on:

  The systemic, global, and structural construction of civilizational
  immunity.

  Without it:

-   Fear will overwhelm reason;

-   Identity illusions will devour diversity;

-   Power will concentrate;

-   Civilization will self-destruct and regress;

-   Humanity will fall into a soft-authoritarian, self-destructive
    cycle.

  Civilizational immunity must become a core global public agenda in the
  21st century.

8.  Author's Statement

  This theory is proposed by Kong Weicheng (孔维程) to promote global
