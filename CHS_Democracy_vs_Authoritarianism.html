1. CHS (Civilization Health Score) is the key metric for measuring the balance between functional civilization capacity and cancerous structural tendencies in individuals or groups.

2. The political system of any nation or society is essentially the result of its citizens’ CHS distribution—not merely the outcome of constitutional texts or the will of a single leader.

3. When the overall CHS > 0:
- A high proportion of functional citizens
- Strong public trust and institutional immunity
- Society naturally evolves toward decentralization, checks and balances, diversity, and democratic governance

4. When the overall CHS < 0:
- A high proportion of low-function citizens
- Weak public trust and fragile institutional immunity
- Society naturally contracts into centralized, closed, and repressive systems

5. Conclusion:
- Democracy is not simply a voting mechanism; it is the natural product of a high-CHS social structure
- Authoritarianism is not merely personal ambition; it is the natural convergence of a low-CHS social structure

Formula:
Political System = f( Average Citizen CHS ± Structural Amplification Coefficient )

Low-CHS Individuals → Structural Evolution Toward Authoritarianism

Step 1: Behavioral Baseline of Low-CHS Individuals
- Limited capacity for trust and cooperation
- Reliance on coercion, hierarchy, and in-group loyalty
- Preference for short-term survival over long-term collective gains

Step 2: Social Aggregation Effects
- When low-CHS individuals form a majority, public trust collapses
- Voluntary cooperation is replaced by enforced compliance
- Informal norms shift toward obedience and avoidance of risk

Step 3: Institutional Consequences
- Power centralizes to “guarantee order”
- Information channels are controlled to minimize dissent
- Institutions lose adaptive capacity, becoming rigid and self-protective

Step 4: Structural Lock-in
- Even if initial leadership changes, low-CHS social fabric recreates centralized structures
- Democratic reforms fail without parallel CHS elevation
- The system’s trajectory remains toward repression, not pluralism

Summary Formula:
Majority Low-CHS Population → Low Trust → Coercive Coordination → Centralization → Authoritarian Lock-in
