1. Overview
•	FFI = 38.5 / 100 (Weak functional structures, with limited freedom and transparency)
•	CSI = 68.5 / 100 (High level of “cancerous” structures, marked by information suppression and power concentration)
•	CHS = -30.0 (Overall negative health score)
•	EOI = 0.7 (Strong external projection through energy resources, military power, and state-controlled narratives)
•	RUI = 47.9 (High reverse unification risk, mainly through hard power and propaganda)
•	HCCI = -14.3 (Net negative contribution to global civilization)

Russia exhibits “hard external influence”, with a hybrid system of political centralization, energy leverage, and information manipulation, resulting in both internal stagnation and global destabilizing effects.
